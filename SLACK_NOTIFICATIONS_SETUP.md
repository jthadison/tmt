# Slack Notifications Setup Guide

## Overview

Your trading system now supports Slack notifications for trade events! You'll receive real-time notifications when:

- üîÑ **Signals are executed** (before trade opens)
- üöÄ **Trades are opened** (with entry details)
- üìä **Trades are updated** (P&L changes)
- üèÅ **Trades are closed** (with final P&L)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **System errors** occur
- üöÄ **System starts/stops**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Slack Webhook

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click "Create New App" ‚Üí "From scratch"
3. Name it "TMT Trading System" and select your workspace
4. Go to "Incoming Webhooks" ‚Üí Enable webhooks
5. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
6. Select the channel where you want notifications
7. Copy the webhook URL (looks like: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

### 2. Configure the Trading System

Set the webhook URL as an environment variable:

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

### 3. Optional: Disable Notifications

If you want to temporarily disable notifications without removing the webhook URL:

```cmd
set NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

## Test the Setup

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
cd E:\projects\claude_code\prop-ai\tmt
python test_slack_notifications.py
```

## Integration Points

The notifications are automatically sent from these components:

1. **Trade Sync Service** (`orchestrator/app/trade_sync/sync_service.py`)
   - Line 143: New trade opened
   - Line 154: Trade closed
   - Line 415: Signal executed

2. **Notification Service** (`orchestrator/app/notifications/slack_service.py`)
   - Formats and sends all notifications
   - Handles different event types
   - Manages HTTP client lifecycle

## Configuration Options

All settings are in `orchestrator/app/config.py`:

- `slack_webhook_url`: Your Slack webhook URL
- `notifications_enabled`: Enable/disable notifications (default: True)

## Troubleshooting

### No notifications appearing
1. Check the webhook URL is correct
2. Verify `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable is set
3. Ensure `NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` is not set to `false`
4. Check orchestrator logs for error messages

### Testing connectivity
Run the simple test:
```bash
python simple_slack_test.py
```

### Manual notification test
```python
import asyncio
import os
from orchestrator.app.notifications import send_system_notification

os.environ['SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL'] = 'your_webhook_url_here'

async def test():
    await send_system_notification("Test", "This is a test notification")

asyncio.run(test())
```

## Security Notes

- Keep your webhook URL secret
- Don't commit webhook URLs to version control
- Use environment variables or secure configuration management
- Consider IP restrictions in Slack app settings for production

## Next Steps

Your trading system will now automatically send notifications for all trade events. The notifications include:

- Real-time trade execution updates
- Profit/loss tracking
- System status messages
- Error alerts

No additional code changes are needed - notifications are fully integrated into your existing trading pipeline!
