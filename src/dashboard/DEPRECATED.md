# DEPRECATED - Legacy Dashboard

⚠️ **This dashboard implementation has been DEPRECATED** ⚠️

## Status: DEPRECATED
**Date**: 2025-08-19
**Reason**: Consolidated into single dashboard at `./dashboard/`

## Migration Complete
All functionality from this legacy dashboard has been migrated to the new dashboard located at:
```
./dashboard/
```

## What was migrated:
✅ Real OANDA API integration  
✅ Performance Analytics functionality  
✅ Environment variable configuration  
✅ Error handling and fallback behavior  

## Next Steps:
1. **Do not use this dashboard** - it will be removed in a future cleanup
2. **Use the new dashboard** at `./dashboard/` 
3. **Update any references** to point to the new dashboard

## New Dashboard Benefits:
- ✅ Modern Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- ✅ Comprehensive testing suite
- ✅ Better component organization
- ✅ Advanced dependencies and features
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket integration
- ✅ Full Performance Analytics with backend

## To start the new dashboard:
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

The new dashboard runs on port 3000 by default and includes all the functionality from this legacy version plus many enhancements.
