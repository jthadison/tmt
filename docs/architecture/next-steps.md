# Next Steps

## Frontend Architect Prompt

Please review the attached Backend Architecture Document (docs/architecture.md) for the Adaptive Trading System and create a comprehensive Frontend Architecture. Focus on the Next.js 14 dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates, multi-account monitoring grid, and emergency trading controls. Ensure dark mode default, responsive design for 1920x1080+ displays, and traffic light status indicators. The frontend must integrate with the defined REST API and WebSocket endpoints while maintaining sub-second update latency for trading data.

## Developer Agent Prompt

Please review the architecture document and begin implementing Epic 1: Foundation & Safety Infrastructure, starting with Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Structure. Use the exact monorepo structure defined in the Source Tree section, configure Docker Compose for local development, and ensure all services expose health check endpoints at /health.
