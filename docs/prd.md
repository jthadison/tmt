# Adaptive/Continuous Learning Autonomous Trading System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable funded traders to pass prop firm challenges and manage 3-6 live funded accounts simultaneously with 99.8% compliance rate
- Achieve 70%+ profitable months through adaptive AI-driven trading strategies in both challenge and live environments
- Reduce trading monitoring time by 60% while maintaining or improving profitability
- Scale traders from $10K to $100K+ monthly income through automated multi-account management
- Eliminate emotional trading decisions through systematic Wyckoff methodology execution
- Maintain undetectable human-like trading patterns to avoid prop firm AI detection systems

### Background Context

The Adaptive/Continuous Learning Autonomous Trading System addresses the critical paradox facing modern funded traders: the need to maintain perfect discipline across multiple prop firm accounts while adapting to changing market conditions, all without triggering automated detection systems. Current solutions fail in opposite extremesâ€”manual trading creates unsustainable cognitive load leading to emotional errors and rule violations, while traditional EAs operate on rigid logic unable to distinguish temporary drawdowns from genuine regime changes.

This system employs eight specialized AI agents collaborating through an event-driven architecture, mastering Wyckoff methodology combined with Volume Price Analysis and Smart Money Concepts. Unlike static bots, it continuously learns from every trade while incorporating anti-contamination safeguards and "learning circuit breakers" to prevent adaptation during suspicious market conditions. The solution uniquely addresses the growing "AI Detection Arms Race" through a Digital Persona Architecture, where each account operates with distinct, evolving trading personalities that maintain profitable variance while avoiding suspicious synchronization patterns.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The interface prioritizes clarity and control, presenting complex multi-account trading data in a scannable, non-overwhelming format. The design philosophy emphasizes "glanceable compliance" where traders can instantly assess account health, risk status, and compliance state across all accounts without detailed inspection. Critical alerts and risk warnings take visual precedence, while routine profitable operations fade into the background.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Single-Screen Command Center:** All critical information visible without navigation, using progressive disclosure for details
- **Traffic Light System:** Green/Yellow/Red visual indicators for instant account status recognition
- **Drag-and-Drop Account Management:** Easily reorganize account priority and groupings
- **One-Click Emergency Controls:** Prominent emergency stop and pause buttons always accessible
- **Context-Sensitive Actions:** Right-click menus and hover states reveal account-specific actions

### Core Screens and Views

- Login/Authentication Screen with 2FA
- Main Dashboard - Multi-Account Command Center
- Individual Account Detail View
- Trade History & Performance Analytics
- Risk Configuration Panel
- Prop Firm Rules Management
- System Health & Agent Status Monitor
- Settings & Personality Configuration

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

### Branding

Professional financial interface aesthetic with dark mode default to reduce eye strain during extended monitoring. Clean, data-focused design inspired by institutional trading platforms like Bloomberg Terminal but with modern usability. Subtle use of brand colors only for critical alerts and CTAs.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop (1920x1080 minimum) with responsive scaling for tablets. Mobile view provides read-only monitoring with emergency stop capabilities.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

We'll use a monorepo structure with clear separation: `/agents` for the 8 AI services, `/execution-engine` for critical trading logic, `/dashboard` for the web interface, `/shared` for common utilities, `/ml-models` for trained models, and `/infrastructure` for deployment configs.

### Service Architecture: Microservices

Event-driven microservices architecture allows each of the 8 agents to operate independently while collaborating through message queues. This provides fault isolation - if one agent fails, others continue operating. We'll use Kafka/NATS for event streaming between agents.

### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid

Given the financial risk and compliance requirements, we need comprehensive testing: unit tests for all agent logic, integration tests for inter-agent communication, end-to-end tests simulating full trading scenarios, and continuous paper trading as a form of production testing. Manual testing convenience methods will allow traders to validate specific scenarios.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python 3.11+ with FastAPI for agent services, CrewAI for agent orchestration, Next.js 14+ with TypeScript for dashboard, Rust/Go for execution engine (<10ms critical path)
- **Database Strategy:** PostgreSQL 15+ for transactional data, TimescaleDB for time-series market data, Redis for real-time state and caching
- **Deployment Target:** Initial development on DigitalOcean/Vultr VPS, production on Google Cloud Platform with multi-region deployment for redundancy
- **API Integrations:** MetaTrader 4/5 bridge for trade execution, FIX protocol support for institutional brokers, REST/WebSocket APIs for market data (OANDA, Polygon.io)
- **Security Requirements:** HashiCorp Vault for secrets management, end-to-end TLS encryption, API key rotation every 90 days
- **Performance Targets:** <100ms signal-to-execution, 1000+ price updates/second processing, 50+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Development Workflow:** GitHub with protected main branch, CI/CD via GitHub Actions, automated testing on every PR, staging environment matching production
- **Monitoring & Observability:** OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, centralized logging with 30-day retention
- **Disaster Recovery:** 15-minute RTO, 1-hour RPO, automated backups every 4 hours, multi-region failover capability

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please review the attached PRD (docs/prd.md) for the Adaptive/Continuous Learning Autonomous Trading System and create comprehensive UX/UI designs. Focus on the dashboard interface that enables traders to monitor multiple prop firm accounts with "glanceable compliance" - instant visual assessment of account health, risk status, and rule compliance. Design for desktop-first (1920x1080) with dark mode default, incorporating traffic light status indicators and one-click emergency controls. The interface must balance information density for professional traders with clarity to reduce cognitive load during extended monitoring sessions.

### Architect Prompt

Please review the attached PRD (docs/prd.md) for the Adaptive/Continuous Learning Autonomous Trading System and create a detailed technical architecture. Design an event-driven microservices architecture supporting 8 specialized AI agents using Python/FastAPI with CrewAI orchestration, a Rust/Go execution engine for <100ms latency, and Next.js dashboard. Address critical technical challenges: multi-agent coordination via Kafka/NATS, MetaTrader 4/5 integration, three-tier circuit breaker implementation, and anti-correlation engine for detection avoidance. Ensure the architecture supports 99.5% uptime, processes 1000+ price updates/second, and maintains complete audit trails. Pay special attention to the learning circuit breaker system that prevents adaptation during suspicious market conditions.
