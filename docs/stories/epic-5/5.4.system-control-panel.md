## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story creates the system control panel for operators to monitor and control the automated trading system. It provides critical safety mechanisms and operational controls for managing the multi-agent trading system across multiple accounts.

### System Architecture Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
The control panel interfaces with the following system components:
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Manages 8 specialized AI agents
- **Circuit Breaker System**: Handles automated safety shutdowns
- **Risk Engine**: Monitors and adjusts risk parameters
- **Execution Engine**: Controls trade execution across platforms
- **Audit System**: Tracks all system operations and changes

### Data Models
