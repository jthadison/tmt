## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundation for the web dashboard interface as part of the overall trading system architecture. The dashboard serves as the primary monitoring and control interface for traders.

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for utility-first CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 2FA support
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections
- **State Management**: React Context for theme and auth state

```

### Authentication Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
- JWT tokens for session management
- 2FA implementation using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- Secure token storage in httpOnly cookies
- Session timeout and refresh token rotation

### WebSocket Communication
[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Real-time updates for account data, positions, and P&L
- Connection resilience with automatic reconnection
- Message queuing during connection downtime
- Heartbeat mechanism for connection health monitoring

### Responsive Design Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Desktop primary: 1920x1080 resolution
- Tablet support: 768px - 1024px viewports
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Touch-friendly interface elements

### Testing Standards
- Component testing using React Testing Library
- E2E testing for authentication flows
- WebSocket connection testing
- Responsive design testing across breakpoints
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 compliance)

## Testing

### Test Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for components
- **Integration Tests**: API integration and WebSocket connections  
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for complete user workflows
- **Visual Tests**: Chromatic for UI regression testing
- **Location**: `dashboard/__tests__/` for unit tests, `e2e/` for end-to-end tests

### Specific Testing Focus
- Authentication flow including 2FA
- Theme switching functionality
- WebSocket connection reliability
- Responsive behavior across devices
- Error handling and loading states
