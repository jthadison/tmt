- Confirmation dialogs with reason codes

### Performance Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Pagination for trade history (25 trades per page)
- Virtual scrolling for large position lists
- Chart data aggregation for different timeframes
- Lazy loading of non-critical sections
- Caching of risk metric calculations

### Testing Standards

- **Integration Tests**: API calls, WebSocket updates, chart interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Complete account analysis workflow, manual overrides
- **Performance Tests**: Large datasets, chart rendering performance
- **Location**: `dashboard/__tests__/components/account-detail/`

### Specific Testing Focus
- Position table real-time updates and sorting
- Trade history filtering and export functionality
- Equity curve chart performance with large datasets
- Risk metric calculation accuracy
- Manual override security and confirmation flow
- Compliance rule violation detection

### Mock Data Requirements
- Position datasets with various P&L scenarios
- Trade history with 100+ entries for pagination testing
