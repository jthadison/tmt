## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story creates the foundation for the anti-detection system by generating unique trading personalities for each account. Each personality acts as a behavioral template that influences all trading decisions, making accounts appear as distinct human traders with individual preferences and characteristics.

### Core Anti-Detection Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/anti-detection-architecture.md]
The personality system is central to avoiding prop firm AI detection by:
- Creating behavioral diversity across accounts
- Establishing consistent but evolving trading patterns
- Masking the underlying algorithmic nature of decisions
- Providing plausible explanations for trading choices

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface TradingPersonality {
  id: string;
  accountId: string;
  profileName: string;
  
  // Core Traits
  traits: {

[Source: docs/architecture/personality-engine.md]
```python
def generate_personality(account_id: str, template: Optional[PersonalityTemplate] = None) -> TradingPersonality:
    # Base trait selection with realistic distributions
    traits = select_realistic_traits(template)
    
    # Generate correlated preferences based on traits
    preferences = generate_correlated_preferences(traits)
    
    # Add realistic variance to avoid perfect correlations
    preferences = add_personality_variance(preferences, variance_factor=0.15)
    
    # Set evolution parameters based on experience level
    evolution = generate_evolution_parameters(traits.experienceLevel)
    
    # Create behavioral modifiers with personality consistency
    modifiers = generate_behavioral_modifiers(traits, preferences)
    
    return TradingPersonality(...)
```

### API Integration

- `POST /api/personalities` - Create new personality
- `GET /api/personalities/{id}` - Get personality details
- `PUT /api/personalities/{id}` - Update personality
- `DELETE /api/personalities/{id}` - Delete personality
- `POST /api/personalities/generate` - Auto-generate personality
- `POST /api/personalities/{id}/evolve` - Trigger evolution
- `GET /api/personalities/templates` - Get personality templates

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE trading_personalities (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id),
    profile_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    traits JSONB NOT NULL,
    preferences JSONB NOT NULL,
    evolution JSONB NOT NULL,

    event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    previous_value JSONB,
    new_value JSONB,
    trigger VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_personalities_account ON trading_personalities(account_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_evolution_log_personality ON personality_evolution_log(personality_id);
```

### Realistic Personality Distribution
[Source: docs/architecture/behavioral-modeling.md]
- **Risk Tolerance**: 30% conservative, 50% moderate, 20% aggressive
- **Trading Style**: 25% scalper, 45% day trader, 30% swing trader
- **Time Preferences**: Distributed based on global trading sessions
- **Experience Levels**: 40% intermediate, 35% novice, 25% advanced
- **Session Focus**: Weighted by account location and time zone

### Evolution Mechanics
[Source: docs/architecture/personality-evolution.md]
- **Skill Improvement**: Gradual increase in win rate and risk tolerance
- **Risk Evolution**: Conservative traders become more aggressive over time
- **Preference Shifts**: Occasional changes in preferred pairs or timing
- **Experience Points**: Accumulated through successful trades and time
- **Evolution Triggers**: Performance milestones, time-based, market events

### Security Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
- **Personality Fingerprinting**: Ensure personalities are not too unique to be tracked
- **Template Mixing**: Avoid using identical templates across accounts
- **Evolution Logging**: Audit trail for all personality changes
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert personality changes if detected
- **Anonymization**: No personally identifiable information in personalities

### Testing Standards
- Test personality generation diversity (1000 generated personalities should be unique)
- Verify trait correlation logic and realistic distributions
- Test evolution mechanics over simulated time periods
- Validate personality influence on trading decisions
- Test dashboard interface for personality management
