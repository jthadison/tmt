## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the decision disagreement system that ensures accounts don't appear coordinated by making different trading decisions on the same signals. This is critical for avoiding prop firm detection algorithms that look for correlated behavior patterns across multiple accounts.

### Anti-Correlation Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/anti-detection-architecture.md]
The disagreement system operates on multiple levels:
- **Signal Level**: Different interpretations of the same market signal
- **Timing Level**: Staggered entry times to avoid simultaneous execution
- **Risk Level**: Varied position sizes based on "personal" risk preferences
- **Exit Level**: Different profit targets and stop loss levels
- **Skip Level**: Some accounts skip signals others take

### Mathematical Foundation
[Source: docs/architecture/correlation-analysis.md]
```python
# Correlation coefficient must stay below 0.7
def calculate_correlation_coefficient(account1_returns, account2_returns):
    return np.corrcoef(account1_returns, account2_returns)[0, 1]

# Target correlation range: 0.3 - 0.6 (realistic for similar strategies)
TARGET_CORRELATION_MIN = 0.3
TARGET_CORRELATION_MAX = 0.6
ALERT_THRESHOLD = 0.7
```

### Human-Like Decision Reasoning
[Source: docs/architecture/decision-reasoning.md]
```python
SKIP_REASONS = [
    "Market too volatile for my risk appetite",
    "Already have similar exposure",
    "Waiting for better entry opportunity",
    "Not convinced by signal strength",
    "Taking a break after recent losses",
    "Prefer to trade different session",
    "Signal came during lunch break",
    "Weekend gap makes me cautious",
    "News event uncertainty",
    "Account approaching daily limit"
]

MODIFICATION_REASONS = [
    "Taking smaller position due to volatility",
    "Adjusting profit target based on support/resistance",
    "Tighter stop loss for risk management",
    "Wider stop loss for volatility buffer",
    "Personal preference for this pair",
    "Account size adjustment",
    "End of week position sizing",
    "Conservative approach during news"
]
```

- **Comprehensive testing** validating core disagreement rate and correlation enforcement

The implementation represents exceptional understanding of prop firm detection risks and provides critical protection through intelligent decision disagreement. This disagreement system is essential for the stealth trading system's ability to avoid detection through correlation analysis while maintaining realistic trading performance across multiple accounts.
