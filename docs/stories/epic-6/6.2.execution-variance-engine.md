## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the execution variance engine that introduces natural human-like imperfections into trade execution. This system ensures that the perfectly precise algorithmic signals are transformed into realistic human trading behavior with natural timing variations, sizing preferences, and occasional mistakes.

### Execution Pipeline Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/execution-engine.md]
The variance engine sits between signal generation and order placement:
```
Signal Generation → Personality Filter → Variance Engine → Order Execution
```

The variance engine must:
- Receive clean algorithmic signals
- Apply personality-driven modifications
- Introduce realistic execution delays
- Log all variance decisions for analysis

        session_factor = self.get_session_factor(signal.timestamp)
        
        delay = base_delay * volatility_factor * session_factor
        delay = clamp(delay, 1, 30)  # Ensure 1-30 second range
        
        # 2. Position Size Rounding
        human_size = self.round_to_human_friendly(
            signal.size, 
            personality.sizing_preferences

- **Personality Engine**: Gets personality preferences
- **Execution Engine**: Sends modified signals for execution
- **Audit System**: Logs all variance decisions
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Displays variance metrics

### Timing Variance Logic
[Source: docs/architecture/behavioral-modeling.md]
```python
def calculate_entry_delay(signal, personality, market_conditions):
    # Base delay from personality (1-10 seconds typically)
    base_delay = personality.timing.base_delay
    
    # Market volatility impact (higher volatility = more hesitation)
    volatility_multiplier = min(2.0, market_conditions.atr_ratio * 1.5)
    
    # Session-based adjustments
    session_multiplier = personality.get_session_confidence(market_conditions.session)
    
    # News event proximity (more delay near news)
    news_multiplier = calculate_news_proximity_factor(signal.timestamp)
    
    # Apply personality consistency (some traders always fast, others always slow)
    consistency_factor = personality.modifiers.consistency_level
    
    total_delay = base_delay * volatility_multiplier * session_multiplier * news_multiplier
    
    # Add random component but keep within personality bounds
    random_component = random_normal(0, base_delay * 0.3)
    final_delay = clamp(total_delay + random_component, 1, 30)
    
    return final_delay
```
