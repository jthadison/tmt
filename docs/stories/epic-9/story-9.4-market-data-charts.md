**Epic**: Trading Operations Dashboard Implementation  
**Story ID**: 9.4  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: 21 points  

## User Story

As a **trading system operator**,  
I want **interactive market data charts and real-time price visualization**,  
so that **I can understand market conditions and validate AI agent trading decisions**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Interactive price charts for actively traded instruments with candlestick, line, and volume displays
2. **AC2**: Real-time price updates with configurable timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
3. **AC3**: Technical indicator overlays including Wyckoff pattern recognition and volume analysis
4. **AC4**: Chart annotations showing AI agent entry/exit points and decision rationale
5. **AC5**: Multi-instrument chart layout with synchronized time navigation and comparison tools

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Market data visualization uses existing TimescaleDB connections without impacting trading system performance
