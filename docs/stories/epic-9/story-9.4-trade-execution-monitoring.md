# Story 9.4: Trade Execution Monitoring Interface

## Story Details
- **Epic**: 9 - Trading Operations Dashboard
- **Type**: Feature
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 points
- **Dependencies**: Story 9.1 (Dashboard Infrastructure), Story 9.3 (OANDA Account Display)

## Description
Implement comprehensive trade execution monitoring interfaces for the Trading Operations Dashboard. This story focuses on providing real-time visibility into all trade executions across multiple accounts and brokers, including order flow, execution quality metrics, and trade lifecycle tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Real-time Trade Execution Feed
- Display live trade executions as they occur across all connected accounts
- Show order details: instrument, direction, size, price, time
- Color-coded status indicators (pending, filled, partial, rejected, cancelled)
- Chronological feed with newest trades at top
- Support for filtering by account, instrument, or status

### AC2: Order Lifecycle Tracking
- Visual representation of order states from submission to completion
- Timeline view showing:
  - Order creation timestamp
  - Submission to broker
  - Acknowledgment received
  - Partial fills (if applicable)
  - Final execution or cancellation
- Latency metrics between each stage
- Alert on unusual delays or failures

### AC3: Execution Quality Metrics
- Display key execution metrics:
  - Fill rate (percentage of orders successfully executed)
  - Average slippage (difference between expected and actual price)
  - Execution speed (time from submission to fill)
  - Rejection rate and reasons
- Aggregate metrics by:
  - Time period (last hour, day, week)
  - Account
  - Instrument
  - Broker/platform
- Visual charts showing trends over time

### AC4: Trade Details Modal
- Detailed view for individual trades showing:
  - Complete order information
  - Execution venue/broker details
  - Associated fees and commissions
  - P&L impact
  - Related orders (stop loss, take profit)
  - Audit trail of all status changes
- Ability to export trade details
- Link to related account and position information

### AC5: Execution Alerts and Notifications
- Real-time alerts for:
  - Failed executions
  - High slippage events (configurable threshold)
  - Partial fills requiring attention
  - Execution delays beyond threshold
- Alert history with acknowledgment tracking
- Integration with system notification system
- Configurable alert rules per account or globally

## Technical Requirements

### Components to Create:
1. **TradeExecutionFeed** - Real-time trade display component
2. **OrderLifecycleTracker** - Order state visualization
3. **ExecutionMetrics** - Quality metrics dashboard
4. **TradeDetailsModal** - Detailed trade information view
5. **ExecutionAlerts** - Alert management component

### Data Models:
```typescript
interface TradeExecution {
  id: string
  accountId: string
  orderId: string
  instrument: string
  direction: 'buy' | 'sell'
  requestedSize: number
  executedSize: number
  requestedPrice: number
  executedPrice: number
  slippage: number
  status: ExecutionStatus
  timestamps: OrderTimestamps
  broker: string
  fees: TradeFees
  relatedOrders: string[]
}

interface OrderTimestamps {
  created: Date
  submitted: Date
  acknowledged?: Date
  partialFills?: PartialFill[]
  completed?: Date
  cancelled?: Date
}

interface ExecutionMetrics {
  fillRate: number
  averageSlippage: number
  averageSpeed: number
  rejectionRate: number
  totalExecutions: number
  successfulExecutions: number
  failedExecutions: number
}
```

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/executions/feed` - Real-time execution feed
- `GET /api/executions/{id}` - Detailed execution info
- `GET /api/executions/metrics` - Aggregated metrics
- `POST /api/executions/alerts` - Configure alerts
- `GET /api/executions/export` - Export execution data

### UI/UX Considerations:
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Smooth animations for state transitions
- Clear visual hierarchy for important information
- Dark theme optimized for extended monitoring
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Integration Points
- WebSocket connection for real-time trade updates
- Integration with OANDA account display (Story 9.3)
- Connection to broker APIs for execution data
- System notification service for alerts
- Export functionality to CSV/JSON formats

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components with >80% coverage
- Integration tests for real-time data flow
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Performance testing with high-volume trade data
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All 5 acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Component documentation complete
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80%
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<100ms render for updates)
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed
- [ ] Merged to main branch

## Notes
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large trade lists
- Ensure proper error handling for WebSocket disconnections
- Implement data caching to reduce API calls
- Consider adding trade replay functionality in future iteration
- Coordinate with backend team on WebSocket event structure
