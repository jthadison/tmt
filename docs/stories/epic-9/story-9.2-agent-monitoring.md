# Story 9.2: AI Agent Status Monitoring Interface

**Epic**: Trading Operations Dashboard Implementation  
**Story ID**: 9.2  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 13 points  

## User Story

As a **trading system operator**,  
I want **real-time visibility into all 8 AI agent statuses and activities**,  
so that **I can monitor system health and identify issues before they impact trading performance**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Agent status dashboard displaying real-time health, activity, and performance metrics for all 8 agents
2. **AC2**: Visual indicators for agent states (active, paused, error, maintenance) with color-coded status displays
3. **AC3**: Agent activity logs showing recent decisions, trade executions, and system interactions
4. **AC4**: Performance metrics display including success rates, response times, and resource utilization
5. **AC5**: Alert notifications for agent failures, timeouts, or performance degradation

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Agent monitoring does not impact existing agent performance or communication protocols
- **IV2**: Status data retrieval maintains compatibility with existing FastAPI backend services
- **IV3**: Real-time updates function correctly without affecting existing agent orchestration

## Technical Notes

- Integrates with 8 specialized AI agents via FastAPI backend
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- Color-coded status system for quick visual assessment
- Performance metrics calculation and display
- Alert system for critical events
