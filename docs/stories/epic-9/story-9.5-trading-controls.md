# Story 9.5: Trading Controls and Manual Intervention

**Epic**: Trading Operations Dashboard Implementation  
**Story ID**: 9.5  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 13 points  

## User Story

As a **system administrator**,  
I want **manual control capabilities for AI agents and emergency intervention with restricted access**,  
so that **I can respond to unusual market conditions and maintain risk management oversight while preventing unauthorized trading interventions**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Individual agent control panel with pause/resume, parameter adjustment, and emergency stop capabilities - **ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS ONLY**
2. **AC2**: System-wide emergency controls including stop-all trading and risk parameter overrides - **ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS ONLY**
3. **AC3**: Manual trade execution interface for direct market intervention when necessary - **ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS ONLY**
4. **AC4**: Risk parameter modification tools with validation against existing compliance rules - **ADMINISTRATOR ACCESS ONLY**
5. **AC5**: Role-based access control validation ensuring only administrator accounts can access trading controls
6. **AC6**: Audit logging of all manual interventions with administrator identification, required justification and approval workflows

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Manual controls integrate properly with existing agent communication protocols without causing conflicts
- **IV2**: Emergency stop functionality maintains data integrity across all system components
- **IV3**: Manual interventions are properly logged in existing audit trail systems for compliance

## Technical Notes

- **CRITICAL SECURITY**: All trading controls require administrator role validation
- Integration with existing role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Emergency stop must be fail-safe and immediate
- All manual interventions require audit trail entries
- Justification and approval workflows for compliance
- Real-time parameter validation against compliance rules

## Dependencies

- Story 9.1: Dashboard Infrastructure (authentication integration)
- Story 9.2: Agent Monitoring (agent communication protocols)
- Existing RBAC and authentication system
- Audit trail system
- Agent communication protocols
- Compliance validation rules
