# Epic 9: Trading Operations Dashboard Implementation

**Epic Goal**: Transform the basic Next.js dashboard foundation into a comprehensive real-time trading operations interface that provides critical monitoring, control, and analytical capabilities for the AI-powered trading system while maintaining existing system integrity and 99.5% uptime requirements.

**Integration Requirements**: Seamless integration with existing 8 AI agents, OANDA API connections, TimescaleDB market data, PostgreSQL trading records, and FastAPI backend services through secure API gateways without disrupting current trading operations.
