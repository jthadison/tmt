# Story 9.5 Implementation Summary: Trading Controls and Manual Intervention

## Overview

Story 9.5 has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive administrator-only trading controls with emergency intervention capabilities, manual trading interfaces, risk parameter modification, and complete audit logging. This implementation prioritizes security, compliance, and operational safety.

## Implementation Architecture

### Security-First Design

The entire implementation follows a security-first approach:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: All operations require administrator authentication
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Every action is logged with justification and risk assessment
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Session Security**: Sessions are validated and have timeout mechanisms
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for high-risk operations

### Component Architecture
