## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The Broker Authentication & Connection Management system serves as the foundational layer for all broker integrations, starting with OANDA. This component ensures secure credential management and reliable connectivity, which are critical for maintaining continuous trading operations. It integrates with the existing execution engine architecture while adding broker-specific capabilities.

### Previous Epic Context
This builds upon the execution infrastructure established in Epic 4 (Execution & Risk Management), extending the platform abstraction layer to support retail brokers alongside prop firm platforms. The authentication system leverages the existing HashiCorp Vault setup from Epic 1 for secure credential storage.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Secure Credential Storage
```python
from hvac import Client
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Optional

class OandaCredentialManager:
    def __init__(self, vault_client: Client):
        self.vault = vault_client
        self.encryption_key = Fernet.generate_key()
        
    async def store_credentials(self, user_id: str, credentials: Dict) -> bool:
        """Store OANDA API credentials securely in Vault"""
        # Validate credentials first
        if not await self.validate_credentials(credentials):
            raise ValueError("Invalid OANDA credentials")
        
        # Encrypt sensitive data
        encrypted = self.encrypt_credentials(credentials)
        
        # Store in Vault
        path = f"secret/oanda/{user_id}"
        self.vault.secrets.kv.v2.create_or_update_secret(
            path=path,
            secret=encrypted
        )
        
        # Audit log
        await self.audit_credential_access(user_id, "store")
        return True
```

#### Connection Pool Implementation
```python
import aiohttp
from asyncio import Queue, Lock
from typing import Optional

class OandaConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, pool_size: int = 10):
        self.pool_size = pool_size
        self.connections: Queue = Queue(maxsize=pool_size)
        self.active_connections: Dict[str, aiohttp.ClientSession] = {}
        self.lock = Lock()
        
    async def initialize(self):
        """Initialize connection pool with pre-warmed connections"""
        for _ in range(self.pool_size):
            session = await self.create_session()
            await self.connections.put(session)
            
    async def acquire(self) -> aiohttp.ClientSession:
        """Acquire a connection from the pool"""
        connection = await self.connections.get()
        
        # Health check before returning
        if not await self.is_healthy(connection):
            connection = await self.create_session()
            
        return connection
```

#### Automatic Reconnection System
```python
class OandaReconnectionManager:
    def __init__(self, max_retries: int = 5):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.reconnect_delay = 1.0  # Start with 1 second
        self.state = ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED
        
    async def handle_disconnection(self):
        """Handle connection loss with automatic reconnection"""
        self.state = ConnectionState.RECONNECTING
        
        for attempt in range(self.max_retries):
            try:
                await asyncio.sleep(self.reconnect_delay)
                
                # Attempt reconnection
                if await self.reconnect():
                    self.state = ConnectionState.CONNECTED
                    self.reconnect_delay = 1.0  # Reset delay
                    await self.notify_reconnection_success()
                    return True
                    
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Reconnection attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
                self.reconnect_delay = min(self.reconnect_delay * 2, 30)  # Exponential backoff
                
        self.state = ConnectionState.FAILED
        await self.notify_reconnection_failure()
        return False
```
