# Story 8.6: Position Management & Modification

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** trader,
**I want** to manage my open OANDA positions,
**so that** I can adjust stops, targets, and close positions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. List all open positions with current P&L
2. Modify stop loss and take profit for open positions
3. Partial position closing (e.g., close 50% of position)
4. Close all positions with single command
5. Position details show entry price, current price, swap charges
6. Calculate position P&L in account currency
7. Position age tracking (time since opened)
8. Trailing stop loss modification support

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Position Management & Modification provides comprehensive control over open trading positions, enabling traders to actively manage risk and optimize performance. This system integrates with the risk management framework while providing intuitive position control capabilities.

### Previous Story Context
Builds on Stories 8.3 (Market Order Execution) and 8.4 (US Regulatory Compliance) to provide ongoing position management after trades are executed. Works with 8.5 (Price Streaming) to provide real-time position valuation.

### Integration Points
- **OANDA Position API**: Real-time position data and modification
- **Price Streaming**: Current market prices for P&L calculation
- **Compliance Engine**: FIFO validation for US accounts
- **Risk Management**: Position-level risk monitoring
- **Dashboard**: Position display and management interface

### Performance Targets
- Position data refresh: <2 seconds
- Position modification: <1 second execution
- Trailing stop updates: <5 seconds after price change
- Bulk operations: <10 seconds for up to 50 positions

## Testing
- Position data accuracy validation
- Stop loss/take profit modification
- Partial closing calculations
- FIFO compliance enforcement
- Trailing stop functionality
- Bulk operation reliability
