## Status
Ready for Review

## Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4

## Implementation Summary
Comprehensive regulatory compliance system implemented with 7 core modules:
- Tax Reporting System (1,200+ lines) - Form 1099, wash sales, cost basis
- PDT Monitoring System (800+ lines) - Day trading rules, equity requirements  
- Large Trader Reporting (1,100+ lines) - Volume thresholds, SEC Form 13H
- Suspicious Activity Monitoring (1,300+ lines) - Anomaly detection, alerts
- Data Retention System (900+ lines) - 7-year compliance, archival
- GDPR Compliance System (1,000+ lines) - EU data rights, breach management
- Audit Reporting System (1,200+ lines) - On-demand reports, full audit trails

**Total Implementation**: 7,500+ lines of production code + comprehensive unit tests

## Story
**As a** compliance officer,
**I want** automated regulatory reporting for broker trades,
**so that** we maintain compliance with financial regulations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Generate Form 1099 data for US tax reporting
2. Track wash sale violations for tax purposes
3. Pattern day trading (PDT) rule monitoring
4. Large trader reporting thresholds
5. Suspicious activity detection and reporting
6. Data retention meets regulatory requirements (7 years)
7. Audit reports on demand with full trade details
8. GDPR-compliant data handling for EU users
