## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Market Order Execution is the core trading functionality that enables immediate position entry through OANDA. This system must achieve sub-100ms execution while maintaining reliability and providing comprehensive tracking of all trades for compliance and analysis purposes.

### Previous Story Context
Builds on Stories 8.1-8.2 which provide authentication and account monitoring. The execution system uses established connections to place orders while tracking all execution details for comprehensive trade management.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### High-Performance Order Executor
```python
class OandaOrderExecutor:
    def __init__(self, client: OandaClient, metrics: MetricsCollector):
        self.client = client
        self.metrics = metrics
        self.order_cache = OrderCache()
