## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The Broker Integration Dashboard provides a unified interface for managing multiple broker connections, giving traders comprehensive visibility and control over their entire broker ecosystem from a single interface.

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Dashboard Components
```typescript
interface BrokerAccount {
  id: string;
  brokerName: string;
  accountType: 'live' | 'demo';
  balance: number;
  equity: number;
  unrealizedPL: number;
  connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'reconnecting';
  lastUpdate: Date;
  capabilities: BrokerCapability[];
  metrics: BrokerMetrics;
}

interface BrokerMetrics {
  avgLatency: number;
  fillQuality: number;
  uptime: number;
  totalTrades: number;
}

const BrokerDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const [brokerAccounts, setBrokerAccounts] = useState<BrokerAccount[]>([]);
  const [aggregateData, setAggregateData] = useState<AggregateData | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.REACT_APP_WS_URL!);
    
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      
      if (data.type === 'BROKER_UPDATE') {
        updateBrokerAccount(data.brokerId, data.updates);
      } else if (data.type === 'AGGREGATE_UPDATE') {
        setAggregateData(data.aggregateData);
      }
    };
    
    return () => ws.close();
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className="broker-dashboard">
      <AggregateOverview data={aggregateData} />
      <div className="broker-accounts-grid">
        {brokerAccounts.map(account => (
          <BrokerAccountCard 
            key={account.id} 
            account={account}
            onConnect={() => handleConnect(account.id)}
            onDisconnect={() => handleDisconnect(account.id)}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
      <BrokerPerformanceChart brokers={brokerAccounts} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Real-time Updates
```typescript
const useBrokerUpdates = () => {
  const [brokers, setBrokers] = useState<BrokerAccount[]>([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/broker-updates');
    
    eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update = JSON.parse(event.data);
      
      setBrokers(prevBrokers => 
        prevBrokers.map(broker => 
          broker.id === update.brokerId 
            ? { ...broker, ...update.changes }
            : broker
        )
      );
    };
    
    return () => eventSource.close();
  }, []);
  
  return brokers;
