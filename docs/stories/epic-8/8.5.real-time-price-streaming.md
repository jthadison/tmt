## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Real-Time Price Streaming provides the live market data foundation for all trading decisions. This system must maintain low-latency, high-frequency price updates while handling network disruptions and market closures gracefully. It serves as the data backbone for the entire broker integration.

### Previous Story Context
Builds on Story 8.1's connection management to establish streaming data connections. The price stream feeds into trading decision engines and provides real-time market context for the execution systems built in Stories 8.3-8.4.
