1. GitHub Actions workflow triggers on PR and merge to main
2. Automated running of unit tests with 80% coverage requirement
3. Build validation for all services (Python, TypeScript, Rust/Go)
4. Staging deployment triggered on main branch updates
5. Deployment rollback capability documented and tested
6. Build status badges displayed in repository README

  - [ ] Add job for TypeScript dashboard testing (Jest)
  - [ ] Add job for Rust execution engine testing
  - [ ] Configure parallel job execution for performance
  - [ ] Add build validation for all services
- [ ] Task 2: Setup staging deployment pipeline (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml`
  - [ ] Configure Google Cloud authentication for GKE deployment
  - [ ] Add deployment steps for each service to staging environment
  - [ ] Configure environment-specific variables and secrets
  - [ ] Add deployment status notifications
- [ ] Task 3: Implement rollback capability (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Document blue-green deployment rollback procedure
  - [ ] Create rollback workflow in GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Test rollback capability with staging environment
  - [ ] Document manual rollback procedures for emergency scenarios
  - [ ] Configure rollback triggers (error rate >1%, latency >500ms)
- [ ] Task 4: Add build status badges and documentation (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add CI/CD status badges to README.md
  - [ ] Document the deployment process and pipeline stages
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common CI/CD issues
  - [ ] Document environment promotion flow

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The deployment strategy follows blue-green deployment with canary releases for critical services, using GitHub Actions for CI/CD with environment-specific workflows. The pipeline must support the 99.5% uptime requirement through reliable automated deployments and quick rollback capabilities. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#deployment-strategy]

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.1 established the foundational repository structure with the necessary directories (`.github/workflows/`) and tooling configurations (pre-commit hooks, testing frameworks). The CI/CD pipeline builds upon this foundation to automate quality gates and deployments.

### Infrastructure Requirements
The deployment pipeline targets Google Cloud Platform with the following environment structure:
- **Development:** Local Docker Compose (covered in Story 1.1)
- **Staging:** GKE cluster in us-central1-a with production-like data but scaled down
- **Production:** Multi-region GKE with HA PostgreSQL and Kafka in us-central1 (primary) and us-east1 (failover)

Environment promotion flow: Development → Staging (PR Merge) → Production Canary (Manual Approval + Integration Tests) → Production Blue-Green Swap (Automated Health Checks + 15min soak time) [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#environment-promotion-flow]

### Technology Stack Integration
The CI/CD pipeline must support multiple technology stacks:
- **Python 3.11.8** agents with pytest 8.0.1 testing framework
- **TypeScript 5.3.3** dashboard with Jest 29.7.0 testing framework  
- **Rust 1.75.0** execution engine with built-in test framework
- **Docker 25.0.3** for containerization across all services
- **Kubernetes 1.29.1** for orchestration on Google Cloud GKE

### Testing Requirements
Based on the test strategy, the CI/CD pipeline must enforce:
- **Coverage Goals:** 80% unit test coverage minimum, 100% for financial calculations and risk management
- **Test Types:** 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% end-to-end tests
- **Framework Integration:** 
  - Python: pytest with pytest-mock for mocking
  - TypeScript: Jest with built-in mocks
  - Rust: Built-in test framework with mockall
- **Performance Testing:** k6 for load testing with targets of 1000 concurrent users, <100ms p95 latency
- **Security Testing:** Semgrep for SAST, OWASP ZAP for DAST, dependency scanning with Snyk

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#continuous-testing]

### Rollback Strategy Implementation
The rollback capability must implement:
- **Primary Method:** Blue-Green instant rollback via load balancer traffic switching
- **Trigger Conditions:** Error rate >1%, latency >500ms, circuit breaker activations, failed health checks
- **Recovery Time Objective:** <60 seconds for application rollback, <5 minutes for database rollback
- **Testing Requirements:** Rollback procedures must be tested in staging environment

[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#rollback-strategy]

### File Locations and Structure
Based on the source tree structure:
- **GitHub Actions workflows:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/staging-deploy.yml`, `.github/workflows/production-deploy.yml`
- **PR Template:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with deployment checklist
- **Scripts:** `scripts/deployment/build-all.sh`, `scripts/deployment/deploy-staging.sh`

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#github-workflows]

### Testing
- **CI Pipeline Testing:** Each workflow must be tested with sample PRs and deployments
- **Integration Tests:** Pipeline must run integration tests in dedicated test environment
- **Performance Validation:** Build times should be optimized for developer productivity
- **Security Validation:** All pipelines must include security scanning and dependency checks
- **Rollback Testing:** Rollback procedures must be validated in staging environment
