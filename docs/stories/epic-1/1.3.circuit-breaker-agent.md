# Story 1.3: Circuit Breaker Agent Core Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system operator,
**I want** emergency stop capabilities at multiple levels,
**so that** I can immediately halt trading when risks are detected.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Circuit Breaker Agent responds to emergency stop commands within 100ms
2. Three-tier breaker system implemented: agent-level, account-level, system-level
3. Breakers trigger on: daily drawdown >5%, max drawdown >8%, unusual market conditions
4. All open positions closed when system-level breaker activates
5. Breaker status exposed via REST API and WebSocket for real-time monitoring
6. Manual override interface to activate breakers from dashboard

  - [ ] Configure API authentication and authorization
- [ ] Task 5: Implement Kafka event integration

  - [ ] Add health check endpoint at `/health`

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The Circuit Breaker Agent is a critical safety component implementing a three-tier safety system (agent/account/system level) to prevent cascade failures during market anomalies. It must respond to emergency stop commands within 100ms and integrate with all other agents for health monitoring. The agent uses Python 3.11 + FastAPI + asyncio for concurrent monitoring. [Source: architecture/components.md#circuit-breaker-agent]

### Previous Story Context
Stories 1.1 and 1.2 established the repository structure (`/agents/circuit-breaker/`) and CI/CD pipeline. The Circuit Breaker Agent builds on the shared agent utilities in `/agents/shared/` including base_agent.py, kafka_client.py, and monitoring.py modules.

### Three-Tier Breaker System Design
The breaker system implements three levels of protection:

1. **Agent-level breakers:** Monitor individual agent health and halt specific agents on failure
2. **Account-level breakers:** Track per-account risk metrics and halt trading for specific accounts
3. **System-level breakers:** Global emergency stops that halt all trading across all accounts

Circuit breaker states: normal, warning, tripped with automatic transitions based on monitoring conditions. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#circuit-breaker-pattern]

### Trigger Conditions Implementation
Based on risk management requirements:
- **Daily drawdown >5%:** Account-level breaker activation
- **Max drawdown >8%:** System-level breaker activation  
- **Unusual market conditions:** Volatility spikes, large gaps, correlation breakdowns
- **Error rate monitoring:** Trip after 5 consecutive failures, half-open after 30s, reset after 3 successes
- **Response time monitoring:** Trigger on latency >500ms sustained

[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#external-api-errors]

### Data Models and Database Integration
Circuit breaker status tracking uses the following data structure:
```sql
circuit_breaker_status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'normal' 
    CHECK (circuit_breaker_status IN ('normal', 'warning', 'tripped'))
```
The agent must integrate with PostgreSQL for persistent state tracking and Redis for real-time status caching. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

### Kafka Event Integration
The Circuit Breaker Agent must handle the following event patterns:
- **Consume:** Monitor events from all other agents for health assessment
- **Publish:** `breaker.agent.triggered` for agent-level stops
- **Publish:** `breaker.system.emergency` for system-wide halts
- **Event Schema:** All events must include correlation_id for distributed tracing

[Source: architecture/components.md#circuit-breaker-agent]

### API Specifications
Based on the REST API specification:
- **GET /api/v1/breaker/status** - Returns current breaker states for all tiers
- **POST /api/v1/breaker/trigger** - Manual emergency stop activation
- **WebSocket /ws/breaker/status** - Real-time status updates for dashboard
- **Response Format:** Standardized API wrapper with `{"data": {...}, "error": null, "correlation_id": "..."}`

[Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md, architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Integration with Execution Engine
The Circuit Breaker Agent must integrate with the Rust execution engine for position closure:
- **Emergency position closure:** Close all open positions when system-level breaker activates
- **Response time requirement:** Position closure commands must be executed within 100ms
- **Retry logic:** Implement exponential backoff for failed closure attempts
- **Verification:** Confirm position closure completion before marking breaker as active

### Error Handling and Resilience
Circuit breaker error handling follows the established patterns:
- **Structured logging:** JSON format with correlation IDs using structlog 24.1.0
- **Exception hierarchy:** Inherit from base `TradingSystemError` class
- **Retry patterns:** Exponential backoff with jitter for external calls
- **Timeout configuration:** 5s default for REST APIs, no timeout for emergency operations
