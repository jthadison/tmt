## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The observability and monitoring foundation provides comprehensive visibility into the multi-agent trading system using OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, Prometheus 2.49.1 for metrics collection, and Grafana 10.3.3 for visualization. The system requires structured logging with correlation IDs and 30-day retention for audit compliance. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Previous Story Context  
Stories 1.1-1.4 established the infrastructure foundation with Docker Compose configuration, shared agent utilities with monitoring.py, Kafka message infrastructure with correlation IDs, and the Circuit Breaker Agent that needs monitoring integration. The observability system builds upon these foundations to provide complete system visibility.

### OpenTelemetry Integration Requirements
Based on the shared utilities structure and coding standards:
- **Implementation location:** `/shared/python-utils/monitoring/tracing.py` for Python services
- **Correlation ID propagation:** Every service operation must propagate correlation IDs through distributed traces
- **Custom spans:** Critical trading operations (signal generation, risk calculation, trade execution) require custom instrumentation
- **Sampling configuration:** Production environments need configurable sampling rates for performance

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#shared-python-utils, architecture/coding-standards.md#structured-logging]

### Prometheus Metrics Strategy
The metrics collection must support both infrastructure and business metrics:

**Core Business Metrics:**
- Trade execution counts and success rates
- Signal generation confidence scores and acceptance rates
- Circuit breaker activation counts by tier (agent/account/system)
- Message latency percentiles between agents (<10ms target)
- Risk calculation response times
- Position sizing accuracy metrics

**Infrastructure Metrics:**
- Service health and availability (99.5% uptime target)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Database connection pool status
- Kafka message throughput and lag

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#99.5%-uptime-requirement]

### Shared Monitoring Utilities
The monitoring utilities must be implemented in the shared Python utilities:
```
shared/python-utils/monitoring/
├── __init__.py
├── metrics.py         # Prometheus metrics collection
└── tracing.py         # OpenTelemetry tracing
```

All agents must use these shared utilities for consistency in:
- Metric naming conventions and labels
- Trace context propagation
- Performance instrumentation
- Error tracking and correlation

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#shared-python-utils-monitoring]

### Grafana Dashboard Requirements
Based on the system architecture, the following dashboards are required:

1. **System Health Dashboard:** Service status, uptime, health check results
2. **Performance Dashboard:** Latency percentiles, throughput, message queue metrics  
3. **Business Dashboard:** Trading metrics, success rates, profit/loss tracking
4. **Infrastructure Dashboard:** Resource utilization, database performance, Kafka metrics

Each dashboard must support the multi-agent architecture with separate panels for each of the 8 agents. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#eight-specialized-agents]

### Alerting Rules Configuration
Critical alerts must be configured for financial system safety:
- **System Level:** Service down, high error rates (>1%), extreme latency (>500ms)
- **Resource Level:** CPU >80%, Memory >70%, disk space <10%
- **Business Level:** Circuit breaker activations, trading halt conditions
- **Security Level:** Authentication failures, unauthorized access attempts

Alert notification must integrate with operational procedures for 99.5% uptime requirement. [Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#rollback-strategy]

### Structured Logging Implementation
All services must implement structured JSON logging with the established standards:
- **Python:** structlog 24.1.0 with JSON formatter
- **TypeScript:** winston 3.11.0 with JSON transport
- **Rust:** tracing 0.1.40 with JSON subscriber
- **Required Context:** correlation_id, service_context (agent_type, version, instance_id), user_context (account_id)

[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]

### Log Retention and Compliance
Log management must support audit compliance requirements:
- **Retention Period:** 30 days for operational logs, 7 years for audit trails
- **Search Capability:** Full-text search with correlation ID and timestamp filtering
- **Security:** No passwords, API keys, or personal information in logs
- **Compression:** Automatic log compression and archival for storage efficiency

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#never-log-sensitive-data]

### Docker Compose Integration
The monitoring stack must be added to the existing Docker Compose configuration:
- **Prometheus:** Port 9090 with configuration volume mount
- **Grafana:** Port 3001 with dashboard provisioning
- **Alertmanager:** Port 9093 with notification configuration
- **Log aggregation:** Centralized logging driver configuration

[Source: Story 1.1 Docker Compose foundation]

### Performance Considerations
The monitoring system must not impact trading performance:
- **Metrics collection:** Minimal overhead with efficient metric libraries
- **Trace sampling:** Configurable sampling rates to balance visibility and performance
- **Log buffering:** Asynchronous log writing to prevent I/O blocking
- **Storage optimization:** Efficient storage and compression for high-volume logs

### Testing Requirements
Comprehensive testing of the monitoring infrastructure:
- **Metrics Testing:** Verify metric accuracy and collection reliability
- **Alerting Testing:** Test alert firing conditions and notification delivery
- **Tracing Testing:** Validate end-to-end trace collection across agents
- **Log Testing:** Verify log format, correlation ID propagation, and retention
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure monitoring overhead is <5% of system resources
