## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The inter-agent communication system uses Apache Kafka 3.6.1 for event streaming with durability guarantees and exactly-once semantics. The system implements an event-driven microservices architecture where agents communicate asynchronously via message queues to ensure resilience and prevent cascade failures. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table, architecture/high-level-architecture.md#event-driven-architecture]

### Previous Story Context
Stories 1.1-1.3 established the repository structure with `/shared/python-utils/messaging/` directory, the Circuit Breaker Agent that needs to consume health events from other agents, and the Docker Compose infrastructure that can host the Kafka message broker.

### Kafka Configuration Requirements
Based on the technology stack and high-level architecture:
- **Apache Kafka 3.6.1** for event streaming
- **Durability guarantees:** exactly-once semantics for financial transactions
- **Message latency target:** <10ms average between agents for the signal-to-execution pipeline
- **Integration:** All agents must use shared Kafka client utilities for consistency

The Kafka broker must be configured in Docker Compose for local development and integrated with Google Cloud Pub/Sub equivalent in production GKE deployment. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Event Schema Design
The system requires standardized event schemas for agent coordination. Based on core workflows analysis:

**Critical Event Types:**
- `trading.signals.generated` - Market Analysis Agent to Risk Agent
- `risk.parameters.updated` - Risk Agent broadcasting updated parameters
- `breaker.agent.triggered` - Circuit Breaker Agent-level stops
- `breaker.system.emergency` - Circuit Breaker system-wide halt
- `personality.variance.applied` - Personality Engine execution variance
- `execution.order.placed` - Execution Engine order placement
- `execution.order.filled` - Execution Engine order completion

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#signal-generation-and-trade-execution-workflow]

### Message Format Standards
All messages must follow the established coding standards:
- **Correlation ID:** Every Kafka message must include correlation_id for distributed tracing
- **Message Format:** Structured JSON with consistent envelope format
- **Idempotency:** Use UUID idempotency keys with 24-hour retention
- **Timeout Configuration:** Message processing must have 30s timeout for database operations

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Delivery Guarantees Implementation
Kafka configuration must provide financial-grade reliability:
- **At-least-once delivery** with consumer acknowledgments
- **Producer settings:** `acks=all` for guaranteed write acknowledgment
- **Consumer settings:** Manual commit after successful processing
- **Retry policy:** Exponential backoff with jitter: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, then dead letter queue
- **Idempotency:** Handle duplicate messages using correlation IDs and database constraints

[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#external-api-errors]

### Shared Client Implementation
The messaging utilities must be implemented in the shared Python utilities:
```
shared/python-utils/messaging/
├── __init__.py
├── kafka_producer.py      # Shared producer with connection pooling
└── kafka_consumer.py      # Shared consumer with group management
```

All agents must use these shared clients for consistency in:
- Connection management and pooling
- Error handling and retry logic
- Correlation ID propagation
- Metrics collection and monitoring

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#shared-python-utils]

### Integration with Agent Architecture
Each agent service must integrate Kafka messaging through:
- **Base Agent:** Shared base_agent.py must include Kafka client initialization
- **Health Monitoring:** Circuit Breaker Agent consumes health events from all agents
- **Signal Flow:** Market Analysis → Risk Management → Personality Engine → Execution
- **Feedback Loops:** Execution results feed back to Learning Agent for adaptation

The messaging system enables the multi-agent coordination required for the 8 specialized AI agents. [Source: architecture/components.md]

### Performance Requirements
The system must achieve ultra-low latency for the critical signal-to-execution path:
- **Target Latency:** <10ms average between agents
- **Critical Path:** Signal detection to execution must be <100ms total
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics must track message latency percentiles
- **Alerting:** Violations of latency thresholds must trigger immediate alerts

[Source: Epic 1.4 AC5]

### Testing Strategy
Message infrastructure requires comprehensive testing:
- **Unit Tests:** Individual producer/consumer functionality
- **Integration Tests:** Multi-agent message flows with real Kafka
- **Performance Tests:** Latency and throughput under load
- **Failure Tests:** Network partitions, broker failures, poison messages
- **Test Harness:** Simulate all agent communication patterns for development

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]

### Error Handling Integration
Message handling must integrate with the established error handling strategy:
- **Structured Logging:** All message processing uses JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Exception Hierarchy:** Message errors inherit from base `TradingSystemError`
- **Dead Letter Queue:** Failed messages route to DLQ for manual investigation
- **Circuit Breakers:** Message processing failures contribute to circuit breaker monitoring
