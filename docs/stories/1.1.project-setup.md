# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly structured monorepo with all necessary configurations,
**so that** the team can begin development with consistent tooling and standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo created with folders: /agents, /execution-engine, /dashboard, /shared, /ml-models, /infrastructure
2. Git repository initialized with .gitignore, README, and protected main branch
3. Development environment setup documented with required tools and versions
4. Pre-commit hooks configured for linting and formatting (Python Black, ESLint, Prettier)
5. Docker Compose configuration for local development of all services
6. Basic health check endpoint responding at /health for each service

- [ ] Task 1: Create monorepo directory structure (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `/agents` directory with shared utilities folder
  - [ ] Create `/execution-engine` directory with Rust project structure
  - [ ] Create `/dashboard` directory with Next.js structure

  - [ ] Create `/infrastructure` directory with terraform, kubernetes, helm subdirectories
- [ ] Task 2: Initialize Git repository with configurations (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Initialize Git repository if not already done
  - [ ] Create comprehensive .gitignore file for Python, TypeScript, Rust, and infrastructure files
  - [ ] Create project README.md with setup instructions and overview
  - [ ] Configure main branch protection rules (require PR, require reviews)
- [ ] Task 3: Setup development environment documentation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Document required tools and versions in README.md
  - [ ] Create installation script for dependencies
  - [ ] Document local development setup process
- [ ] Task 4: Configure pre-commit hooks (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create .pre-commit-config.yaml with Black, ESLint, Prettier
  - [ ] Configure Python Black formatting (version 24.2.0)
  - [ ] Configure ESLint for TypeScript (version 8.56.0)
  - [ ] Configure Prettier for code formatting
  - [ ] Test pre-commit hooks functionality
- [ ] Task 5: Setup Docker Compose for local development (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create root docker-compose.yml file
  - [ ] Configure PostgreSQL service with TimescaleDB extension
  - [ ] Configure Redis service for caching
  - [ ] Configure Kafka service for message queuing
  - [ ] Configure monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
  - [ ] Create separate docker-compose.prod.yml for production
- [ ] Task 6: Implement basic health check endpoints (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create health check endpoint structure for agents (Python/FastAPI)
  - [ ] Create health check endpoint for execution engine (Rust)
  - [ ] Create health check endpoint for dashboard (Next.js)
  - [ ] Verify all health endpoints respond correctly

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundational repository structure as defined in the source tree architecture. The monorepo approach was chosen to simplify dependency management, enable atomic commits across services, and provide shared type definitions and utilities. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]

### Source Tree Structure
The following directory structure must be created exactly as specified in the architecture:
- `/agents/` - AI agent microservices with shared utilities in `/agents/shared/`
- `/execution-engine/` - Rust-based high-performance execution system 
- `/dashboard/` - Next.js trading dashboard with TypeScript
- `/shared/` - Shared libraries including types, python-utils, and database schemas
- `/ml-models/` - Machine learning model storage and training
- `/infrastructure/` - Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, Kubernetes, and Helm configurations
- `/scripts/` - Automation scripts for setup, deployment, testing, and maintenance
- `/docs/` - Documentation including architecture, API docs, and runbooks

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#complete-structure]

### Technology Stack Requirements
Based on the tech stack specifications:
- **Python 3.11.8** for AI agents with FastAPI 0.109.1
- **Rust 1.75.0** for execution engine
- **TypeScript 5.3.3** with Node.js 20.11.0 for dashboard
- **Next.js 14.1.0** for frontend framework
- **Docker 25.0.3** for containerization
- **PostgreSQL 15.6** with TimescaleDB 2.14.2 extension
- **Apache Kafka 3.6.1** for event streaming
- **Redis 7.2.4** for real-time state management

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Coding Standards Integration
Pre-commit hooks must enforce the established coding standards:
- **Python**: Black 24.2.0 (deterministic, zero-config formatting)
- **TypeScript**: ESLint 8.56.0 with Prettier for code quality
- **Rust**: rustfmt with default configuration
- **File Naming**: snake_case for Python, camelCase for TypeScript functions, PascalCase for components

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]

### Infrastructure Configuration
Docker Compose must provide local development equivalents of the production infrastructure:
- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for both transactional and time-series data
- Redis for real-time state caching
- Kafka for inter-service messaging
- Monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana
- Each service must have proper network isolation and service discovery

[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md#environments]

### Health Check Requirements
All services require /health endpoints for monitoring:
- **Response format**: Standardized API wrapper with `{"data": {...}, "error": null, "correlation_id": "..."}`
- **Timeout requirements**: 5s for HTTP responses
- **Monitoring integration**: Must be compatible with Prometheus metrics collection
- **Circuit breaker integration**: Health checks feed into circuit breaker logic

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Testing
Based on testing strategy requirements:
- **Test Structure**: Tests should mirror source structure
- **Python**: pytest 8.0.1 framework with `test_*.py` files in `/tests/` directories
- **TypeScript**: Jest 29.7.0 with `*.test.ts` files alongside source
- **Rust**: Built-in test framework with `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage required
- **Test Infrastructure**: Use Testcontainers for database testing, WireMock for API stubbing
