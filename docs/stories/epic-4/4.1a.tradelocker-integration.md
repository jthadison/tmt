# Story 4.1a: TradeLocker Platform Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As an** execution system,
**I want** direct integration with TradeLocker platform,
**so that** I can execute trades on prop firm accounts using their modern API.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. TradeLocker REST API and WebSocket integration fully functional
2. OAuth2 authentication with automatic token refresh implemented
3. Order execution completes within 150ms of signal generation
4. Real-time position and account updates via WebSocket
5. Support for all order types: market, limit, stop, stop-limit
6. Automatic reconnection and session recovery on disconnection
7. Rate limiting compliance with TradeLocker API limits
8. Multi-account support with session management

  - [x] Add execution timing metrics and monitoring

- [x] Task 5: Implement rate limiting and compliance (AC: 7)
  - [x] Add rate limiter with configurable thresholds
  - [x] Implement request queuing when approaching limits
  - [x] Create backpressure handling
  - [x] Add rate limit monitoring and alerting
  - [x] Implement circuit breaker for API protection

- [x] Task 6: Build multi-account management (AC: 8)
  - [x] Create account session pool management
  - [x] Implement account switching logic
  - [x] Add account-specific rate limiting
  - [x] Create account health monitoring
  - [x] Implement load balancing across accounts

- [x] Task 7: Create error handling and recovery (AC: 6)
  - [x] Implement comprehensive error code handling
  - [x] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [x] Create fallback mechanisms for API failures
  - [x] Build state recovery after disconnection
  - [x] Add detailed error logging and alerting

## Dev Notes

### API Endpoints Required
- Authentication: `POST /auth/token`
- Orders: `POST /orders`, `PUT /orders/{id}`, `DELETE /orders/{id}`
- Positions: `GET /positions`, `PUT /positions/{id}`
- Account: `GET /account`, `GET /account/balance`
- WebSocket: `wss://api.tradelocker.com/ws`

### Performance Considerations
- TradeLocker typically has 50-100ms API latency
- WebSocket provides real-time updates with <10ms latency
- Rate limits: 100 requests/second for REST, unlimited WebSocket

### Integration Architecture
- Use platform abstraction layer for vendor-agnostic interface
- Implement as microservice in execution-engine
- Store credentials in HashiCorp Vault
- Use Kafka for internal event distribution

## Testing
- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests with TradeLocker sandbox
- Load testing for rate limit compliance
- Failover testing for connection resilience
- End-to-end latency testing

## Dependencies
- Platform Abstraction Layer (Story 4.1c)
- HashiCorp Vault configuration
- Kafka event streaming setup
- TradeLocker sandbox account for testing
