# Story 4.1c: Trading Platform Abstraction Layer

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** trading system architect,
**I want** a unified platform abstraction layer,
**so that** the system can seamlessly work with multiple trading platforms without code duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unified interface for TradeLocker, DXtrade, and future platforms
2. Platform-agnostic order and position management
3. Automatic platform selection based on account configuration
4. Standardized error handling across all platforms
5. Performance overhead less than 5ms per operation
6. Hot-swappable platform implementations without downtime
7. Comprehensive platform capability detection
8. Unified event stream for all platform events

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Design
```rust
// Core trait all platforms must implement
trait ITradingPlatform {
    async fn connect(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
    async fn place_order(&self, order: UnifiedOrder) -> Result<OrderId>;
    async fn modify_order(&self, id: OrderId, mods: OrderModification) -> Result<()>;
    async fn cancel_order(&self, id: OrderId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn get_positions(&self) -> Result<Vec<Position>>;
    async fn get_account(&self) -> Result<AccountInfo>;
    fn capabilities(&self) -> PlatformCapabilities;
}

// Platform factory for dynamic selection
struct PlatformFactory {
    fn create_platform(config: PlatformConfig) -> Box<dyn ITradingPlatform>
}
```

### Standardized Models
- **UnifiedOrder:** Platform-agnostic order representation
- **Position:** Normalized position across platforms
- **AccountInfo:** Standardized account information
- **PlatformEvent:** Unified event structure
- **ErrorCode:** Standardized error taxonomy

### Performance Requirements
- Abstraction overhead: <5ms per operation
- Event processing: <1ms per event
- Platform switching: <100ms
- Memory overhead: <10MB per platform connection

### Platform Capability Matrix
| Capability | TradeLocker | DXtrade | Future Platform |
|------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| Market Orders | ✓ | ✓ | ? |
| Limit Orders | ✓ | ✓ | ? |
| Stop Orders | ✓ | ✓ | ? |
| Trailing Stop | ✓ | ✗ | ? |
| OCO Orders | ✓ | ✓ | ? |
| Partial Fill | ✓ | ✓ | ? |
| WebSocket | ✓ | ✗ (FIX) | ? |

## Testing
- Unit tests for each abstraction interface
- Integration tests with mock platforms
- Platform adapter tests
- Performance benchmarking
- Capability detection testing
- Event normalization testing
- Error translation testing

## Implementation Language
- **Primary:** Rust (for performance-critical paths)
- **Bindings:** Python bindings for AI agents
- **Why Rust:** Zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, performance

## Dependencies
- TradeLocker Integration (Story 4.1a)
- DXtrade Integration (Story 4.1b)
- Execution Engine architecture

## Future Extensibility
- Support for MetaTrader if needed later
- cTrader platform support
- Interactive Brokers API
- Cryptocurrency exchange APIs
- Custom prop firm platforms
