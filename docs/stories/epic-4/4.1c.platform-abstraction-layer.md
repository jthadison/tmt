trait ITradingPlatform {
    async fn connect(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
    async fn place_order(&self, order: UnifiedOrder) -> Result<OrderId>;
    async fn modify_order(&self, id: OrderId, mods: OrderModification) -> Result<()>;
    async fn cancel_order(&self, id: OrderId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn get_positions(&self) -> Result<Vec<Position>>;
    async fn get_account(&self) -> Result<AccountInfo>;
