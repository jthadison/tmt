### Integration Points
- **TradeLocker WebSocket:** Real-time position updates
- **TradeLocker REST:** Order placement with stop-loss
- **Compliance Agent:** Rule enforcement coordination
- **Risk Agent:** Position sizing based on 2% rule
- **Dashboard:** Real-time compliance display

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Approach daily loss limit**
   - Test at 3.2% (80% warning)
   - Test at 3.6% (90% warning)
   - Test at 3.8% (95% alert)
   - Test at 4.0% (block trades)

2. **Weekend closure**
   - Test auto-closure at 4:50 PM EST
   - Test with multiple open positions
   - Test with pending orders
   - Test manual override

3. **Stop-loss enforcement**
   - Test order rejection without SL
   - Test automatic SL calculation
   - Test SL modification rules

## Dependencies
