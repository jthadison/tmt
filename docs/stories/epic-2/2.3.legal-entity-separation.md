## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The Legal Entity Separation System ensures regulatory compliance by maintaining complete separation between trading accounts, preventing any appearance of coordinated trading that could violate prop firm terms or financial regulations. Each account operates as an independent legal entity with its own decision-making process, audit trail, and compliance documentation. This system is critical for scaling to 10+ accounts while maintaining legal compliance.

### Previous Story Context
Stories 2.1 and 2.2 established the prop firm rules engine and multi-account configuration. The Legal Entity Separation System builds on this by adding the compliance layer that ensures each account operates independently with proper legal structure and documentation.

### Legal Entity Data Model
Based on the database schema requirements:
```sql
CREATE TABLE legal_entities (
    entity_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    entity_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    entity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- LLC, Corporation, Trust
    jurisdiction VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    registration_number VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    tax_id VARCHAR(50),
    registered_address TEXT NOT NULL,
    mailing_address TEXT,
    incorporation_date DATE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    tos_accepted_version VARCHAR(20),
    tos_accepted_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    tos_accepted_ip INET,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE entity_audit_logs (
    log_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    entity_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES legal_entities(entity_id),
    account_id UUID REFERENCES trading_accounts(account_id),
    action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    action_details JSONB NOT NULL,
    decision_rationale TEXT,
    correlation_id UUID NOT NULL,
    signature VARCHAR(256), -- Cryptographic signature
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    INDEX idx_entity_audit_entity (entity_id),
    INDEX idx_entity_audit_timestamp (created_at)
);
```

### Decision Independence Implementation
Strategies to ensure decision independence:

1. **Temporal Separation:** Random delays (5-30 seconds) between similar decisions across entities
2. **Rationale Variation:** Different analysis templates and wording per entity
3. **Data Isolation:** Separate analysis contexts with no shared state
4. **Personality Variation:** Each entity has distinct trading personality
5. **Execution Variance:** Different timing and sizing even for similar signals

Example decision log structure:
```json
{
  "entity_id": "uuid",
  "account_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "decision_type": "trade_entry",
  "analysis": {
    "market_condition": "Bullish trend identified",
    "technical_indicators": ["MA crossover", "RSI oversold"],
    "confidence": 78.5,
    "rationale": "Entity-specific analysis narrative"
  },
  "action": {
    "type": "buy",
    "symbol": "EURUSD",
    "size": 0.1,
    "entry": 1.0950
  },
  "independent_factors": {
    "decision_delay_ms": 12500,
    "personality_influence": "conservative",
    "unique_seed": "random_uuid"
  }
}
```

### Audit Trail Requirements
Comprehensive audit logging for regulatory compliance:

**Required Fields:**
- Timestamp (microsecond precision)
- Entity ID and account ID
- Action type (trade, configuration, analysis)
- Complete action details (JSON)
- Decision rationale (text narrative)
- Correlation ID for distributed tracing
- Cryptographic signature for integrity

**Retention Policy:**
- 7 years for trade-related logs (regulatory requirement)
- 2 years for operational logs
- Immutable storage with write-once policy
- Automated archival to cold storage after 1 year

**Integrity Measures:**
- SHA-256 hash of each log entry
- Blockchain-style chaining of log hashes
- Regular integrity verification scans
- Tamper detection alerts

### Compliance Reporting Templates
Entity separation reports must include:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Total entities and accounts
   - Compliance score (percentage)
   - Key findings and recommendations

2. **Independence Analysis**
   - Decision timing distribution
   - Correlation coefficients between entities
   - Statistical tests for independence

3. **Trading Pattern Analysis**
   - Per-entity trading characteristics
   - Unique behaviors per entity
   - Variance in execution patterns

4. **Audit Trail Summary**
   - Total logged actions per entity
   - Completeness verification
   - Integrity check results

5. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Jurisdiction-specific requirements met
   - ToS acceptance status
   - Geographic restriction compliance

### Terms of Service Management
ToS tracking implementation:

```python
class ToSManager:
    def track_acceptance(self, entity_id, version, ip_address):
        # Record acceptance with full context
        # Generate legally-binding record
        # Notify relevant systems
        
    def check_compliance(self, entity_id):
        # Verify current ToS accepted
        # Check for required updates
        # Return compliance status
        
    def generate_acceptance_proof(self, entity_id):
        # Create PDF with acceptance details
        # Include digital signature
        # Store in permanent archive
```

### Geographic Restrictions
Jurisdiction-based trading controls:

**Restricted Regions Database:**
- US states with specific regulations
- EU countries under MiFID II
- Sanctioned countries (OFAC list)
- Prop firm specific restrictions

**Implementation:**
- IP geolocation for access control
- Trading hour restrictions per timezone
- Holiday calendars per jurisdiction
- Regulatory report requirements per region

**VPN/Proxy Detection:**
- IP reputation checking
- Datacenter IP detection
- Timezone consistency validation
- Multiple authentication factors

### Integration with Other Systems
The Legal Entity system integrates with:
- **Compliance Agent:** Provides entity context for rule validation
- **Personality Engine:** Assigns unique personalities per entity
- **Audit System:** Centralizes all compliance logging
- **Dashboard:** Entity management and compliance monitoring UI

### Reporting API Endpoints
- **GET /api/v1/entities** - List all legal entities
- **POST /api/v1/entities** - Create new legal entity
- **GET /api/v1/entities/{id}/compliance** - Entity compliance status

- **POST /api/v1/entities/{id}/tos-accept** - Record ToS acceptance
- **GET /api/v1/reports/entity-separation** - Generate compliance report

### Testing Requirements
- **Compliance tests:** Verify complete entity separation
- **Audit tests:** Validate log completeness and integrity
- **Report tests:** Ensure accurate compliance reporting
- **Geographic tests:** Verify restriction enforcement
- **ToS tests:** Validate acceptance tracking
- **Independence tests:** Statistical verification of entity separation
- **Performance tests:** Handle 100+ entities with full audit logging
