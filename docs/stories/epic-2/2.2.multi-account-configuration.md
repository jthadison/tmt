## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The Multi-Account Configuration Management system is critical for managing multiple prop firm accounts with different rules, credentials, and trading parameters. This system must securely store sensitive broker credentials using HashiCorp Vault while providing flexible configuration management for traders operating across multiple firms. The system supports the PRD goal of managing 10+ accounts simultaneously.

### Previous Story Context
Story 2.1 established the Prop Firm Rules Engine with specific rule configurations for FTMO, FundedNext, and MyForexFunds. This story builds on that foundation by providing the account management layer that associates each account with its specific prop firm rules and trading parameters.

### Data Model Requirements
Based on the database schema, the account configuration includes:
```sql
trading_accounts:
- account_id UUID PRIMARY KEY
- prop_firm VARCHAR(50) - Links to prop firm rules
- account_number VARCHAR(100) - Broker account identifier
- legal_entity_id UUID - For compliance separation
- personality_profile_id UUID - For anti-detection variance
- status VARCHAR(20) - active, suspended, in_drawdown, terminated
- balance DECIMAL(12,2) - Current account balance
- equity DECIMAL(12,2) - Current account equity
- max_daily_loss DECIMAL(12,2) - Daily loss limit
- max_total_loss DECIMAL(12,2) - Maximum drawdown allowed
- encrypted_credentials TEXT - Vault-encrypted broker credentials
```
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#trading-accounts]

### HashiCorp Vault Integration
Credential security implementation using Vault 1.15.6:
- **Storage path:** `/secret/trading-accounts/{account_id}/credentials`
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with automatic key rotation
- **Access control:** Service account with minimal permissions
- **Audit logging:** All credential access logged with correlation IDs
- **Emergency procedures:** Break-glass access for critical situations

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#secrets-management]

### Account Configuration Schema
Comprehensive configuration structure:
```json
{
  "account_id": "uuid",
  "prop_firm": "FTMO|FundedNext|MyForexFunds",
  "broker_credentials": {
    "broker": "MetaTrader4|MetaTrader5",
    "server": "server.broker.com:443",
    "login": "encrypted_login",
    "password": "vault_reference",
    "investor_password": "vault_reference"
  },
  "trading_parameters": {
    "allowed_pairs": ["EURUSD", "GBPUSD", "USDJPY"],
    "max_positions": 3,
    "max_lot_size": 0.5,
    "allowed_timeframes": ["M5", "M15", "H1"],
    "trading_hours": "00:00-23:59",
    "weekend_trading": false
  },
  "risk_limits": {
    "max_daily_loss_percent": 5.0,
    "max_total_loss_percent": 10.0,
    "max_position_size_percent": 2.0,
    "max_correlation": 0.7,
    "require_stop_loss": true
  },
  "personality_profile": "conservative_scalper",
  "legal_entity_id": "uuid",
  "notification_settings": {
    "email": "encrypted_email",
    "webhook_url": "encrypted_url",
    "alert_on_violation": true
  }
}
```

### 2FA Implementation
Security requirements for configuration changes:
- **Method:** Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) RFC 6238
- **Library:** Python: pyotp for TOTP generation/validation
- **QR Code:** Generate using qrcode library for authenticator apps
- **Backup codes:** Generate 10 single-use recovery codes
- **Session management:** 2FA verification valid for 15 minutes
- **Required for:** Account creation, credential updates, deletion

### Status Management State Machine
Account status transitions and rules:
```
active → suspended: Manual action or minor violation
active → in_drawdown: Daily/total loss threshold reached
suspended → active: Manual reactivation after review
in_drawdown → active: Next trading day or equity restored
any → terminated: Critical violation or manual termination
terminated → [none]: No recovery, requires new account
```

Status-based restrictions:
- **active:** Full trading allowed
- **suspended:** Read-only, no new positions
- **in_drawdown:** Close-only mode
- **terminated:** No access, credentials purged

### Import/Export Format
Configuration backup and migration format:
```yaml
version: "1.0"
export_date: "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
accounts:
  - account_id: "uuid"
    prop_firm: "FTMO"
    configuration: {...}
    risk_limits: {...}
    trading_parameters: {...}
metadata:
  total_accounts: 5
  export_reason: "backup|migration"
  encrypted_fields: ["credentials", "personal_data"]
```

### API Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with account-specific claims
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (trader, admin, viewer)
- **Rate limiting:** 100 requests per minute per account
- **Input validation:** Strict schema validation for all inputs
- **Audit logging:** Every configuration change logged with user/timestamp

### Integration Points
The configuration management system integrates with:
- **Compliance Agent:** Provides prop firm rules per account
- **Personality Engine:** Links personality profiles to accounts
- **Execution Engine:** Supplies broker credentials and parameters
- **Circuit Breaker:** Status updates trigger trading halts
- **Dashboard:** Real-time account status and configuration UI

### WebSocket Events
Real-time configuration updates:
- `account.created` - New account added
- `account.updated` - Configuration changed
- `account.status.changed` - Status transition occurred
- `account.deleted` - Account removed
- `credentials.rotated` - Credentials updated

### Testing Requirements
- **Security tests:** Vault integration, encryption, 2FA flow
- **API tests:** CRUD operations, validation, error handling
- **Status tests:** All state transitions and restrictions
- **Import/export tests:** Data integrity, format validation
- **Performance tests:** Handle 100+ accounts efficiently
- **Integration tests:** Verify all agent interactions
