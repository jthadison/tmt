## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The Compliance Agent is responsible for ensuring all trades comply with prop firm rules to maintain account funding and prevent violations that could lead to account termination. This agent must validate every trade before execution and continuously monitor account state against firm-specific rules. The system targets 99.8% compliance rates as specified in the PRD. [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Previous Epic Context
Epic 1 established the foundation with Circuit Breaker Agent for emergency stops, Kafka messaging for inter-agent communication, and monitoring infrastructure. The Compliance Agent builds on this foundation, integrating with the Circuit Breaker for rule-based trading halts and using Kafka events for real-time trade validation.

### Data Models and Schema
The compliance system uses the following database schema:
```sql
trading_accounts:
- prop_firm VARCHAR(50) - FTMO, MyForexFunds, FundedNext
- max_daily_loss DECIMAL(12,2) - Daily loss limit
- max_total_loss DECIMAL(12,2) - Maximum allowed drawdown
- current_daily_pnl DECIMAL(12,2) - Running daily P&L
- status VARCHAR(20) - active, suspended, in_drawdown, terminated
```
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#trading-accounts]

### Prop Firm Rule Specifications
Based on PROP_FIRM_SPECIFICATIONS.md and current platform migration:

**DNA Funded Rules:**
- Daily loss limit: 5% of initial balance
- Max loss limit: 10% of initial balance (trailing)
- News trading: Blocked 2 min before and after high-impact news
- Maximum positions: 5 concurrent positions
- Consistency: Max 30% of total profit in single day
- Platform: TradeLocker (primary), DXtrade (secondary)

**Funding Pips Rules:**
- Daily loss limit: 4% of initial balance
- Max loss limit: 8% of initial balance (static)
- Minimum holding time: 1 minute for all positions
- Weekend holding: Not allowed (positions must be closed)
- Stop loss: Mandatory for all trades
- Platform: DXtrade (primary), TradeLocker (secondary)

**The Funded Trader Rules:**
- Daily loss limit: 5% of initial balance (higher of initial or current)
- Max loss limit: 10% of initial balance (trailing)
- News trading: Blocked 5 min before/after high-impact (Standard/Rapid)
- Maximum positions: 10 concurrent positions
- Scaling plan: 25% increase every 3 months with 10% profit
- Platform: TradeLocker (primary), DXtrade (secondary)

### Integration with Trading Flow
The Compliance Agent integrates into the trading workflow:
1. Market Analysis Agent generates signal → Compliance validates rules
2. Risk Management calculates position → Compliance checks size limits
3. Before execution → Compliance final validation
4. During position hold → Compliance monitors holding time
5. Before close → Compliance validates minimum hold time met

### Event Integration
Kafka events for compliance monitoring:
- **Consume:** `trading.signals.generated` for pre-trade validation
- **Consume:** `execution.order.placed` for position tracking
- **Publish:** `compliance.validation.passed` for approved trades
- **Publish:** `compliance.violation.detected` for rule violations
- **Publish:** `compliance.account.suspended` for critical violations

### API Endpoints
The Compliance Agent exposes:
- **GET /api/v1/compliance/validate-trade** - Pre-trade validation
- **GET /api/v1/compliance/account-status/{account_id}** - Current compliance state
- **GET /api/v1/compliance/violations/{account_id}** - Violation history
- **POST /api/v1/compliance/update-rules** - Update prop firm rules
- **GET /api/v1/compliance/pnl/{account_id}** - Real-time P&L status

### Economic Calendar Integration
News trading restrictions require external data:
- **Primary source:** ForexFactory or Investing.com economic calendar API
- **Update frequency:** Every 5 minutes for upcoming events
- **Event classification:** High (NFP, FOMC), Medium (GDP, CPI), Low (minor indicators)
- **Time windows:** Configurable per prop firm (typically 2-5 min before/after)

[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

### Real-time P&L Calculation
P&L tracking implementation requirements:
- **Update frequency:** Every tick for open positions
- **Daily reset:** Configurable time per prop firm (usually midnight broker time)
- **Calculation method:** Unrealized P&L = (Current Price - Entry Price) × Position Size × Pip Value
- **Persistence:** Store snapshots every minute for recovery
- **Precision:** Use Decimal type for all monetary calculations

### Violation Prevention Strategy
Multi-layer validation approach:
1. **Pre-trade validation:** Check all rules before order submission
2. **Real-time monitoring:** Continuous P&L and drawdown tracking
3. **Circuit breaker integration:** Trigger emergency stop on critical violations
4. **Grace periods:** Warning zones at 80% of limits
5. **Auto-recovery:** Resume trading when conditions normalize

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests:** Each rule validator with edge cases
- **Integration tests:** Full trade validation flow with multiple prop firms
- **Compliance tests:** Verify 99.8% accuracy target
- **Performance tests:** Validation must complete within 50ms
- **Scenario tests:** News events, drawdown recovery, multiple violations

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Error Handling
Compliance-specific error handling:
- **PropFirmRuleViolation:** Base exception for all rule violations
- **DailyLossExceeded:** Daily limit reached
- **MaxDrawdownExceeded:** Account max loss reached
- **NewsBlackoutViolation:** Trading during restricted news period
- **MinimumHoldTimeViolation:** Position closed too early

All errors must include account_id, rule violated, current values, and limits.
