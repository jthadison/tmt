## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The Anti-Correlation Engine is essential for preventing detection of automated or coordinated trading across multiple accounts. This system monitors trading patterns across all accounts and actively introduces variance to maintain the appearance of independent human traders. The engine works with the Personality Engine to create unique trading behaviors while maintaining profitability.

### Previous Story Context
Stories 2.1-2.3 established prop firm compliance, multi-account management, and legal entity separation. The Anti-Correlation Engine builds on this foundation by adding the technical layer that ensures accounts don't exhibit suspicious coordination patterns that could trigger prop firm detection systems.

### Correlation Calculation Methods
Implementation of correlation monitoring:

**Pearson Correlation Coefficient:**
```python
def calculate_correlation(account1_positions, account2_positions):
    """
    Calculate correlation between two accounts' positions
    Range: -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive)
    Threshold: >0.7 indicates concerning correlation
    """
    # Position vectors: [EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, ...]
    # Values: position size (negative for short)
    correlation = pearsonr(account1_positions, account2_positions)
    return correlation.coefficient, correlation.p_value
```

**Multi-Dimensional Correlation Factors:**
1. **Position correlation:** Same instruments, same direction
2. **Timing correlation:** Entry/exit within similar timeframes
3. **Size correlation:** Proportional position sizes
4. **P&L correlation:** Similar profit/loss patterns
5. **Behavior correlation:** Similar trading patterns

### Correlation Monitoring Architecture
Real-time monitoring system design:
```python
class CorrelationMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.correlation_matrix = {}  # NxN matrix for N accounts
        self.time_windows = [300, 3600, 86400]  # 5min, 1hr, 1day
        self.thresholds = {
            'info': 0.5,
            'warning': 0.7,
            'critical': 0.9
        }
    
    def update_correlations(self):
        # Calculate pairwise correlations
        # Update correlation matrix
        # Trigger alerts if thresholds exceeded
        # Publish to WebSocket for real-time updates
```

### Position Adjustment Strategies
Methods to reduce correlation when detected:

1. **Gradual Reduction:**
   - Reduce position sizes proportionally
   - Close partial positions to decrease correlation
   - Maintain profitability while reducing exposure

2. **Position Hedging:**
   - Add offsetting positions in one account
   - Use correlated pairs to balance exposure
   - Maintain overall directional bias

3. **Rotation Strategy:**
   - Rotate positions between accounts
   - Shift timing of entries/exits
   - Vary position holds across accounts

4. **Diversification:**
   - Add uncorrelated instruments
   - Vary trading strategies per account
   - Use different timeframes

### Execution Timing Variance Algorithm
Intelligent delay implementation:
```python
class ExecutionDelayManager:
    def calculate_delay(self, account_id, base_signal_time):
        """
        Generate intelligent delay based on multiple factors
        """
        factors = {
            'base_random': random.uniform(1, 30),  # 1-30 seconds
            'market_volatility': self.get_volatility_adjustment(),
            'account_personality': self.get_personality_delay(account_id),
            'recent_correlation': self.get_correlation_adjustment(),
            'time_of_day': self.get_session_adjustment()
        }
        
        delay = sum(factors.values()) / len(factors)
        
        # Ensure critical trades aren't delayed excessively
        if self.is_critical_signal():
            delay = min(delay, 5)  # Max 5 seconds for critical
            
        return delay
```

### Position Size Variance Implementation
Size randomization while maintaining risk:
```python
def apply_size_variance(base_size, account_id):
    """
    Apply 5-15% variance to position size
    """
    # Get account-specific variance profile
    variance_profile = get_variance_profile(account_id)
    
    # Generate variance factor
    variance = random.uniform(0.05, 0.15)
    
    # Apply directional bias based on personality
    if variance_profile['aggressive']:
        adjusted_size = base_size * (1 + variance)
    else:
        adjusted_size = base_size * (1 - variance)
    
    # Ensure within risk limits
    adjusted_size = validate_risk_limits(adjusted_size, account_id)
    
    return adjusted_size
```

### Correlation Database Schema
Storage for correlation tracking:
```sql
CREATE TABLE correlation_metrics (
    metric_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    account_1_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES trading_accounts(account_id),
    account_2_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES trading_accounts(account_id),
    correlation_coefficient DECIMAL(5,4) NOT NULL,
    p_value DECIMAL(5,4),
    time_window INTEGER NOT NULL, -- seconds
    calculation_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    position_correlation DECIMAL(5,4),
    timing_correlation DECIMAL(5,4),
    size_correlation DECIMAL(5,4),
    pnl_correlation DECIMAL(5,4),
    
    INDEX idx_correlation_accounts (account_1_id, account_2_id),
    INDEX idx_correlation_time (calculation_time),
    INDEX idx_correlation_coefficient (correlation_coefficient)
);

CREATE TABLE correlation_adjustments (
    adjustment_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    account_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES trading_accounts(account_id),
    adjustment_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    adjustment_value JSONB NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT,
    correlation_before DECIMAL(5,4),
    correlation_after DECIMAL(5,4),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Integration with Personality Engine
Coordination with personality-based variance:
- Each account's personality influences variance patterns
- Aggressive personalities: larger size variance, shorter delays
- Conservative personalities: smaller variance, longer delays
- Personalities remain consistent to avoid detection

### Correlation Reporting Format
Daily report structure:
```json
{
  "report_date": "2024-01-01",
  "summary": {
    "total_accounts": 10,
    "high_correlation_pairs": 2,
    "average_correlation": 0.35,

    "timing_delays_applied": 145,
    "size_variances_applied": 89,
    "positions_adjusted": 12
  }
}
```

```javascript
// WebSocket message format
{
  "type": "correlation_update",
  "data": {
    "account_pair": ["account_1", "account_2"],
    "correlation": 0.75,
    "threshold_exceeded": true,
    "severity": "warning",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```
