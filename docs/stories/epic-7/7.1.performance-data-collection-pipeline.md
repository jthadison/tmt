## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story creates the foundation for the adaptive learning system by implementing a comprehensive data collection pipeline that captures every aspect of trading performance. This data becomes the fuel for all learning, optimization, and improvement processes in the system.

### Data Collection Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/data-collection-architecture.md]
The pipeline operates in real-time with multiple collection points:
- **Pre-Trade**: Signal generation context, market conditions, account state
- **During Trade**: Execution quality, slippage, timing metrics
- **Post-Trade**: Performance outcomes, market evolution, impact analysis
- **Continuous**: Market regime classification, volatility measures, correlation updates
