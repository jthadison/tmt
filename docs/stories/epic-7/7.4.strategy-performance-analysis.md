## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements a comprehensive strategy performance analysis system that continuously evaluates the effectiveness of different trading strategies, identifies underperforming approaches, and provides recommendations for strategy optimization. This enables the system to maintain a portfolio of only the most effective strategies while adapting to changing market conditions.

### Strategy Analysis Framework
[Source: docs/architecture/strategy-analysis.md]
The analysis operates on multiple dimensions:
- **Individual Performance**: Each strategy evaluated independently
- **Market Regime Sensitivity**: How strategies perform in different market conditions
- **Cross-Strategy Correlation**: Diversification benefits and risks
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Performance evolution over time
- **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**: Performance relative to risk taken
