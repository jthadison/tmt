# Story 7.2: Learning Circuit Breaker Implementation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements critical safety mechanisms that prevent the learning system from being corrupted by abnormal market conditions, manipulation attempts, or other data poisoning scenarios. This is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing the AI from learning harmful behaviors.

### Circuit Breaker Philosophy
[Source: docs/architecture/learning-safety.md]
The learning circuit breaker follows the principle of "fail-safe" operation:
- **Conservative by Default**: When in doubt, don't learn
- **Multiple Validation Layers**: Multiple independent checks before learning
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues trading but stops adapting
- **Quick Recovery**: Rapid return to learning when conditions normalize
- **Human Oversight**: Manual controls for complex scenarios

### Safety Mechanisms
[Source: docs/architecture/safety-mechanisms.md]
```
Learning Pipeline: Data → Validation → Circuit Breaker → Learning Engine
                                      ↓
                               Quarantine System ← Manual Review
