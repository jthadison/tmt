# Story 13.2: Parameter Suggestion Engine & Shadow Testing Framework

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** trading system operator,
**I want** an intelligent parameter suggestion engine that generates optimization recommendations based on performance analysis and a shadow testing framework that validates suggestions through A/B testing with 10% signal allocation,
**so that** parameter improvements are validated with real trading data before deployment, minimizing risk while enabling continuous optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `ParameterSuggestionEngine` generates suggestions for low win rate sessions (<45%)
2. `ParameterSuggestionEngine` generates suggestions for high win rate low volume sessions (>60%, <5 trades)
3. `ParameterSuggestionEngine` generates suggestions for low R:R sessions (<2.0)
4. Each `ParameterSuggestion` includes all required fields (session, parameter, values, reason, improvement, confidence)
5. Suggestions sorted by expected_improvement descending
6. `ShadowTester` allocates exactly 10% of signals to test variation
7. Shadow test runs for minimum 7 days before evaluation
8. Statistical significance calculated using t-test with p-value <0.05
9. `shadow_tests` database table stores all active test metadata
10. `start_test()` method creates test and begins signal allocation
11. `evaluate_test()` method calculates performance comparison (control vs test)
12. `terminate_test()` method stops signal allocation and archives test results
13. Integration test: full shadow test lifecycle with simulated 7 days of trades
14. Unit test: suggestion engine correctly identifies 20% improvement scenario

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Story 13.1**: Autonomous Learning Loop with Performance Analyzer
- AutonomousLearningAgent class created with continuous_learning_loop()
- PerformanceAnalyzer calculates metrics by session, pattern, confidence buckets
- Learning cycle runs every 24 hours
- Statistical significance requires n≥20 trades
- Audit trail logging implemented
- API endpoint `/api/v1/learning/status` returns cycle state

**Key Learnings from 13.1**:
- TradeRepository integration from Epic 12 database
- PerformanceAnalysis data model with session/pattern/confidence metrics
- Cycle state management (IDLE, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Feature flag ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_LEARNING controls loop activation
- Asyncio scheduling for 24-hour cycles

### Architecture Context

**Agent Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.11.8 for AI agents
- FastAPI 0.109.1 for API services
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- scipy for statistical calculations (t-test)
- pytest 8.0.1 for testing

**Existing Components** [Source: agents/learning-safety/app/ and agents/continuous-improvement/app/]
- Learning Safety Agent at Port 8004 (existing)
- ABTestingFramework already exists in learning-safety agent
- ShadowTestingEngine already exists in continuous-improvement agent
- This story creates NEW ParameterSuggestionEngine and ShadowTester (may reference existing code patterns)

**File Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- New files for this story:
  - `agents/learning-safety/app/parameter_optimizer.py`
  - `agents/learning-safety/app/shadow_tester.py`
  - `agents/learning-safety/app/models/suggestion_models.py`
  - `orchestrator/app/database/shadow_test_repository.py`
  - `orchestrator/app/database/migrations/002_add_shadow_tests.sql`
  - Database models update: `orchestrator/app/database/models.py` (add ShadowTest ORM model)

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Python classes: PascalCase (ParameterSuggestionEngine, ShadowTester)
- Python functions: snake_case (generate_suggestions, start_test, evaluate_test)
- Database tables: snake_case plural (shadow_tests)
- All monetary values must use Decimal type
- All API responses use standardized wrapper
- Docstrings required for all public methods

**Critical Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use dependency injection (inject repositories, not instantiate directly)
- All monetary values use Decimal type (win_rate, avg_rr, improvement_pct, p_value)
- Never log sensitive data
- All async operations have timeouts
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs

**Database Schema** [Source: epic technical notes]
Complete shadow_tests table schema provided in epic document with:
- 22 columns including test metadata, metrics, and evaluation results
- Status field with CHECK constraint (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, TERMINATED, DEPLOYED)
- Indexes on status and start_date for query performance
- Decimal precision for all percentage/ratio fields

**Integration Points**
- AutonomousLearningAgent (Story 13.1) - consumes suggestions, manages shadow tests
- TradeRepository (Epic 12) - source of trade data for test evaluation
- Orchestrator (Port 8089) - applies test/control parameters during signal execution
- Market Analysis Agent (Port 8001) - signal generation uses allocated parameters
- Database migrations (Epic 12 framework) - adds shadow_tests table

**Suggestion Generation Rules**
From epic requirements:
1. Low win rate: if win_rate < 45% → increase confidence_threshold by +5%
2. High win rate low volume: if win_rate > 60% AND trade_count < 5 → decrease confidence_threshold by -5%
3. Low R:R: if avg_rr < 2.0 → increase min_risk_reward by +0.2

**Statistical Significance Requirements**
- Minimum sample size: n ≥ 20 for suggestion generation
- T-test for shadow test evaluation: p-value < 0.05
- Minimum test group size: n ≥ 30 trades before deployment consideration
- Improvement threshold: > 20% performance improvement for deployment

**Shadow Testing Configuration**
- Allocation: 10% of signals to test group, 90% to control group
- Minimum duration: 7 days before evaluation
- Minimum sample: 30 test trades required
- Max p-value: 0.05 for statistical significance
- One test per parameter/session combination at a time

**Parameter Bounds**
Reasonable bounds for suggestions:
- confidence_threshold: 40% to 95% (reject suggestions outside this range)
- min_risk_reward: 1.5 to 5.0 (reject suggestions outside this range)

**T-Test Implementation**
Use scipy.stats.ttest_ind() for independent samples t-test:
- Compare control group P&L vs test group P&L
- Null hypothesis: no difference between groups
- Alternative hypothesis: test group performs better
- Two-tailed test
- Returns: (statistic, p_value)
- Significance threshold: p_value < 0.05

**Signal Allocation Strategy**
- Random allocation using random.random() < allocation_pct
- Orchestrator checks active tests for each signal's session
- Apply test parameters if allocated to TEST group
- Apply current parameters if allocated to CONTROL group
- Tag each trade with group and test_id for tracking

**Compatibility Requirements**
- Additive enhancement (existing trading unaffected)
- 90% of signals use current parameters (control group)
- Only 10% of signals affected by testing
- Tests can be terminated immediately if needed
- Feature flag controls shadow testing activation

**Risk Mitigation**
- 10% allocation limits blast radius

- Database queries use SQLAlchemy ORM parameterization (prevents SQL injection)
- Parameter bounds validation prevents malicious suggestions
- Test allocation percentage validated (0-1 range)
- Statistical p-values validated for reasonable ranges
- Repository pattern abstracts database access

**Recommendations:**
- ✅ Already implemented: Parameter bounds validation
- ✅ Already implemented: Statistical threshold validation
- ✅ Already implemented: Proper error handling without exposing internals
- Consider adding authentication for shadow test API endpoints (if exposed externally)
- Consider rate limiting for terminate_test() to prevent abuse

### Performance Considerations

✓ **EXCELLENT** - Efficient implementation with proper optimizations

**Performance Optimizations Implemented:**

- **Command Pattern**: start_test(), evaluate_test(), terminate_test() as commands
- **Dependency Injection**: All dependencies injected via constructor
- **Data Transfer Object**: ParameterSuggestion and TestEvaluation as DTOs
- **Statistical Testing**: Proper t-test implementation with scipy

**Separation of Concerns:**
```
ParameterSuggestionEngine → Generates optimization suggestions
    ├─> 3 suggestion rules (low win rate, high win rate low volume, low R:R)
    └─> Parameter bounds validation

ShadowTester → Manages A/B testing lifecycle
    ├─> allocate_signal_to_group() → 10% random allocation
    ├─> record_trade_result() → Track control/test performance
    ├─> evaluate_test() → Statistical significance testing
    └─> terminate_test() → Emergency stop capability

ShadowTestRepository → Database persistence
    ├─> create_test() → Persist test metadata
    ├─> get_active_tests() → Query active tests
    ├─> update_test_metrics() → Update performance metrics
    └─> complete_test() → Mark test as completed
```

**Design Strengths:**
- Clean interfaces with single responsibilities
- No tight coupling between components
- Easy to test with mocked dependencies
- Extensible for future enhancement (new suggestion rules)
- Proper use of statistical libraries (scipy)
- Data models with validation

- ✅ Two-tailed test for robustness
- ✅ Significance threshold: p < 0.05 (industry standard)
- ✅ Minimum sample size: n ≥ 30 (statistical best practice)
- ✅ Improvement threshold: >20% (prevents marginal deployments)
