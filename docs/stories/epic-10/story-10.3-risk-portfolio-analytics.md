# Story 10.3: Risk Management & Portfolio Analytics Engine

## Epic
Epic 10: High-Performance Trading Infrastructure

## Story Overview
Implement a comprehensive Risk Management & Portfolio Analytics Engine that provides real-time risk monitoring, portfolio performance analysis, compliance reporting, and advanced risk controls across all trading accounts and strategies.

## Business Context
The Risk Management & Portfolio Analytics Engine serves as the critical safety and performance monitoring layer for the entire trading system. It must provide real-time risk assessment, portfolio optimization insights, and compliance monitoring to ensure safe and profitable trading operations while meeting regulatory requirements.

## User Stories
As a **prop firm trader**, I want real-time risk monitoring and portfolio analytics so that I can make informed decisions and avoid excessive risk exposure.

As a **compliance officer**, I want comprehensive reporting and audit trails so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and risk management standards.

As a **system administrator**, I want advanced risk controls and kill switches so that I can protect the system from catastrophic losses.
