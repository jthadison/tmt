   - Authentication and token management
   - Connection pooling and retry logic

3. **Order Management System** (`app/orders/order_manager.py`)
   - Order lifecycle management
   - Execution tracking and confirmation
   - Partial fill handling
   - Order modification and cancellation

4. **Position Management** (`app/positions/position_manager.py`)
   - Real-time position tracking
   - P&L calculation and monitoring
   - Position sizing and risk validation
   - Historical position data

5. **Risk Management** (`app/risk/risk_manager.py`)
   - Pre-trade risk validation
   - Position size limits enforcement
   - Leverage and margin checks
   - Emergency controls and circuit breakers

6. **Performance Monitoring** (`app/monitoring/metrics.py`)
   - Latency tracking and optimization
   - Order fill rate analysis
   - Slippage monitoring
   - System performance dashboards

### Key Features
- **Sub-100ms Execution**: Optimized order processing pipeline
- **Multi-Account Support**: Concurrent trading across multiple accounts
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Live price feeds and position updates
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail for compliance
- **Emergency Controls**: Kill switch and risk circuit breakers
