### Key Metrics Categories

#### Execution Performance
- `execution_order_duration_seconds` - Order execution latency histograms
- `execution_orders_total` - Total order execution counters
- `execution_position_duration_seconds` - Position operation latency
- `execution_positions_total` - Position operation counters

#### Quality Metrics
- `execution_slippage_basis_points` - Order slippage measurements
- `execution_fill_quality_ratio` - Fill quality vs expected price
- `execution_rejection_total` - Order rejection counters by reason
- `execution_retry_attempts_total` - Retry attempt tracking

#### System Health
- `execution_memory_usage_bytes` - Memory consumption monitoring
- `execution_cpu_usage_percent` - CPU utilization tracking
- `execution_connection_pool_size` - Connection pool metrics
