# Story 10.5: Position Management System

**Epic 10: Core Trading Infrastructure - MVP Implementation**

## Story Overview
Implement a high-performance position management system that tracks all trading positions with real-time P&L calculation, margin monitoring, and position lifecycle management from open to close.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Real-Time Position Tracking
- GIVEN active trading positions
- WHEN market prices update
- THEN system calculates real-time unrealized P&L for all positions
- AND updates position metrics within 1 second of price changes
- AND maintains position state consistency across all components

### AC2: Position Opening
- GIVEN an order fill event
- WHEN creating or updating a position
- THEN system handles new position creation and position pyramiding
- AND calculates weighted average entry price for multiple entries
- AND updates position size and margin requirements
- AND completes position opening in <50ms

### AC3: Position Closing
- GIVEN a position close request
- WHEN executing position closure
- THEN system supports both partial and full position closes
- AND calculates realized P&L accurately
- AND completes position close in <100ms (95th percentile)
- AND maintains audit trail of all position changes

### AC4: Multi-Account Support
- GIVEN multiple trading accounts
- WHEN managing positions
- THEN system maintains separate position tracking per account
- AND provides consolidated portfolio views
- AND supports account-specific margin calculations
- AND handles cross-account risk aggregation

### AC5: Position Aggregation
- GIVEN multiple orders for the same instrument
- WHEN orders are filled
- THEN system aggregates positions by instrument per account
- AND maintains accurate average entry price calculations
- AND handles position reversals (long to short transitions)
- AND tracks all contributing order IDs

### AC6: Margin Monitoring
- GIVEN open positions
- WHEN calculating margin requirements
- THEN system tracks margin used per position
- AND provides total margin utilization per account
- AND calculates available margin for new positions
- AND integrates with OANDA margin calculations

### AC7: Performance Metrics
- GIVEN position operations
- WHEN executing position management tasks
- THEN system provides performance metrics and statistics
- AND tracks total positions, open positions, and P&L summaries
- AND monitors position manager resource usage
- AND reports position synchronization status

### AC8: Position Synchronization
- GIVEN OANDA position data
- WHEN synchronizing local state
- THEN system maintains consistency with broker positions
- AND resolves discrepancies automatically
- AND provides fallback mechanisms for API failures
- AND logs all synchronization events

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **PositionManager** (`execution-engine/app/positions/position_manager.py`)
  - Real-time position tracking with background price updates
  - Position lifecycle management (open/modify/close)
  - Multi-account portfolio management
  - Margin calculation and monitoring

### Key Features
- Asynchronous position monitoring with configurable update intervals
- Position aggregation and average price calculation algorithms
- Real-time P&L calculation using current market prices
- Position close with support for partial and full closures
- Background synchronization with OANDA position data
- Performance tracking and metrics collection
- Account summary generation with position data

### Performance Requirements
- Position opening: <50ms
- Position closing: <100ms (95th percentile)
- Price update processing: <1 second
- Memory usage: <200MB for position manager
- Support for 100+ concurrent positions per account

### Data Models
- **Position**: Core position entity with units, prices, and P&L
- **PositionCloseRequest**: Request structure for position closure
- **AccountSummary**: Comprehensive account state with positions
- **PositionSide**: Enumeration for LONG/SHORT position sides

### Integration Points
- **OANDA API**: Position data, margin information, current prices
- **Order Manager**: Position updates from order fills
- **Risk Manager**: Position data for risk calculations
- **Metrics System**: Position performance monitoring

## Validation Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Position management system is fully operational with real-time tracking, P&L calculation, and comprehensive position lifecycle management.

## Files Modified/Created
- `execution-engine/app/positions/position_manager.py` - Core position management logic
- `execution-engine/app/positions/__init__.py` - Position module initialization
- `execution-engine/app/core/models.py` - Position-related data models

## Dependencies
- **Story 10.1**: Market data integration for real-time pricing
- **Story 10.2**: Execution engine for order processing
- **Story 10.4**: Risk management for position validation
