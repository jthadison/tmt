## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Platform API changes | Medium | High | Version pinning, change monitoring |
| Performance degradation | Medium | High | Extensive benchmarking, optimization |
| Integration complexity | High | Medium | Platform abstraction layer |
| Data migration issues | Low | High | Comprehensive testing, rollback plan |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Prop firm rule changes | Medium | Medium | Regular rule updates, monitoring |
| Platform downtime | Low | High | Multi-platform support, failover |
| Compliance violations | Low | Critical | Extensive testing, monitoring |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | Buffer time, parallel development |

## Rollback Strategy

### Phase-Based Rollback Points
1. **After Architecture Phase:** Can abort with minimal impact
2. **After Abstraction Layer:** Can maintain dual platform support
3. **After Platform Integration:** Can selectively enable/disable platforms
4. **After Prop Firm Integration:** Can revert rules while keeping platforms
5. **After UAT:** Full rollback procedure available

### Rollback Procedure
1. Stop all trading operations
2. Preserve current state and logs
3. Revert configuration to previous platform
4. Restore database to checkpoint
5. Restart services with old configuration
6. Validate system functionality
7. Resume operations

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
- ✓ All platforms integrated successfully
- ✓ Latency remains under 150ms
- ✓ 99.5% uptime maintained
- ✓ All tests pass with >90% coverage
- ✓ Zero critical bugs in production

### Business Success Metrics
- ✓ All prop firm rules implemented
- ✓ Successful trades on all platforms
- ✓ Compliance validation passing
- ✓ User training completed

- External consultants: $15,000 (platform expertise)
- Infrastructure: $5,000 (testing environments)
- Licenses: $3,000 (development tools)

### Total Estimated Cost: $180,000 - $220,000
