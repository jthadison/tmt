## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### Scheduled Alert Types

#### 1. Daily P&L vs Projection Alerts
**Schedule**: Daily at 17:00 UTC (NY market close)
**Function**: `check_daily_pnl_vs_projection()`

```python
# Compares actual daily P&L against Monte Carlo projections
# Triggers alerts for confidence interval breaches
# Integrates with existing performance tracking system
```

**Alert Conditions**:
- P&L deviation >25% (Warning)
- P&L deviation >50% (Critical)
- Confidence interval breaches (Warning to Critical based on consecutive count)

#### 2. Weekly Stability Score Monitoring
**Schedule**: Monday at 08:00 UTC
**Function**: `check_weekly_stability_score()`

```python
# Monitors forward testing stability metrics
# Tracks walk-forward stability and out-of-sample validation
# Compares against target thresholds from forward testing analysis
```

**Alert Conditions**:
- Walk-forward stability <60/100 (Warning)
- Walk-forward stability <50/100 (Critical)
- Out-of-sample validation <70/100 (Warning)
- Out-of-sample validation <50/100 (Critical)

#### 3. Monthly Forward Test Updates
**Schedule**: 1st of month at 09:00 UTC
**Function**: `update_monthly_forward_test()`

```python
# Triggers Monte Carlo engine to update projections
# Compares new projections with previous month
# Alerts on significant changes in expected performance
```

**Alert Conditions**:
- Expected P&L change >25% (Warning)
- Expected P&L change >50% (Critical)
- Stability metrics below baseline (Critical)

#### 4. Performance Threshold Notifications
**Schedule**: Daily at 12:00 UTC and 22:00 UTC
**Function**: `check_performance_thresholds()`

```python
# Real-time threshold monitoring
# Focuses on critical and emergency alerts only
# Provides rapid response for severe conditions
```

**Alert Conditions**:
- Critical threshold breaches
- Emergency conditions requiring immediate action

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### Default Schedule Configuration

| Alert Name | Frequency | Time (UTC) | Function |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| `daily_pnl_check` | Daily | 17:00 | Daily P&L vs projection comparison |
| `weekly_stability_check` | Weekly (Monday) | 08:00 | Stability score monitoring |
| `monthly_forward_test_update` | Monthly (1st) | 09:00 | Forward test updates |
| `performance_threshold_check` | Daily | 12:00 | Mid-day threshold monitoring |
| `evening_performance_check` | Daily | 22:00 | Evening threshold monitoring |

### Alert Thresholds

```python
# Sharpe Ratio Thresholds
SHARPE_WARNING = 0.8
SHARPE_CRITICAL = 0.5
SHARPE_DEGRADATION_WARNING = -0.3  # 30% degradation
SHARPE_DEGRADATION_CRITICAL = -0.5  # 50% degradation

# Confidence Breach Thresholds
CONSECUTIVE_BREACH_WARNING = 3
CONSECUTIVE_BREACH_CRITICAL = 5
BREACH_RATE_WARNING = 0.15  # 15% over 30 days
BREACH_RATE_CRITICAL = 0.25  # 25% over 30 days

# Forward Test Stability Thresholds (from analysis)
WALK_FORWARD_TARGET = 60.0  # Target >60/100
OUT_OF_SAMPLE_TARGET = 70.0  # Target >70/100
CURRENT_WALK_FORWARD = 34.4  # Current baseline
CURRENT_OUT_OF_SAMPLE = 17.4  # Current baseline
