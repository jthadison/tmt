# Epic 4: Execution & Risk Management

Build trade execution pipeline with position sizing and real-time risk monitoring. This epic delivers the critical execution layer that transforms signals into profitable trades while managing risk.

## Story 4.1: MetaTrader Bridge Implementation

As an execution system,
I want direct integration with MT4/MT5 platforms,
so that I can execute trades on prop firm accounts.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: MT4/MT5 bridge supports market and pending orders
2: Order execution completes within 100ms of signal generation
3: Position modification (SL/TP adjustment) supported in real-time
4: Account synchronization updates positions every second
5: Connection monitoring with automatic reconnection on failure
6: Order rejection handling with reason codes and retry logic

## Story 4.2: Dynamic Position Sizing Calculator

As a risk management system,
I want to calculate optimal position sizes,
so that risk is controlled while maximizing returns.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Position size based on account balance, risk percentage, and stop loss distance
2: Volatility-adjusted sizing using ATR multiplier (reduce size in high volatility)
3: Account drawdown adjustment (reduce size by 50% after 3% drawdown)
4: Correlation-based size reduction when multiple correlated positions exist
5: Prop firm maximum position limits enforced per account
6: Position size variance between accounts for anti-detection

## Story 4.3: Real-Time Risk Monitoring

As a risk manager,
I want continuous monitoring of all risk metrics,
so that I can prevent excessive losses.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Real-time P&L calculation updated every tick
2: Drawdown tracking: daily, weekly, and maximum drawdown
3: Exposure monitoring across all positions and accounts
4: Risk-reward tracking for open positions
5: Margin level monitoring with warnings at 150% and 120%
6: Automated position reduction when risk thresholds approached

## Story 4.4: Trade Execution Orchestrator

As a trade coordinator,
I want intelligent routing of trades to appropriate accounts,
so that opportunities are maximized while respecting limits.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Account selection based on available margin and risk budget
2: Trade distribution across accounts with anti-correlation logic
3: Execution timing variance (1-30 seconds) between accounts
4: Partial fill handling with completion monitoring
5: Failed execution recovery with alternative account routing
6: Execution audit log with timestamps and decision rationale

## Story 4.5: Stop Loss and Take Profit Management

As a position manager,
I want dynamic adjustment of exit levels,
so that profits are maximized while protecting capital.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Trailing stop implementation with ATR-based distance
2: Break-even stop movement after 1:1 risk-reward achieved
3: Partial profit taking at predetermined levels (50% at 1:1, 25% at 2:1)
4: Time-based exits for positions exceeding expected hold time
5: News event protection with tightened stops before high-impact events
6: Exit level modifications logged with reasoning
