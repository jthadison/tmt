# Epic 3: Market Intelligence & Signal Generation  

Deploy Wyckoff pattern detection and core trading signal generation with confidence scoring. This epic delivers the intelligence layer that identifies high-probability trading opportunities based on market structure analysis.

## Story 3.1: Market Data Integration Pipeline

As a trading system,
I want real-time market data from multiple sources,
so that I can analyze price action and generate signals.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: WebSocket connections to OANDA, Polygon.io for real-time forex/index data
2: Data normalized into standard OHLCV format with <50ms processing time
3: Automatic reconnection with data gap recovery on disconnection
4: Historical data backfill for 2 years of 1-minute candles
5: Market data stored in TimescaleDB with efficient time-series queries
6: Data quality monitoring detects gaps, spikes, and anomalies

## Story 3.2: Wyckoff Pattern Detection Engine

As a signal generation system,
I want to identify Wyckoff accumulation and distribution patterns,
so that I can trade with institutional order flow.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Wyckoff phase identification: accumulation, markup, distribution, markdown
2: Spring and upthrust detection with volume confirmation
3: Support/resistance zone identification using volume profile
4: Pattern confidence scoring from 0-100% based on multiple criteria
5: Multi-timeframe validation (M5, M15, H1, H4) for pattern confirmation
6: Pattern performance tracking to validate detection accuracy

## Story 3.3: Volume Price Analysis Integration

As a market analyst,
I want volume-based insights combined with price action,
so that I can confirm the strength of detected patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Volume spike detection (>2x average) with price action context
2: Volume divergence identification (price up/volume down scenarios)
3: Accumulation/distribution line calculation and trend analysis
4: Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) bands for entry/exit zones
5: Smart money vs retail volume classification algorithm
6: Volume profile creation showing high-volume nodes as S/R levels

## Story 3.4: Signal Generation and Scoring System

As a trading system,
I want high-confidence trade signals with entry/exit parameters,
so that I can execute profitable trades systematically.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Signal generation only when confidence score >75%
2: Entry price, stop loss, and take profit levels calculated for each signal
3: Risk-reward ratio minimum 1:2 enforced for all signals
4: Maximum 3 signals per week per account to avoid overtrading
5: Signal metadata includes pattern type, confidence, expected hold time
6: Signal performance tracking with win rate and profit factor metrics

## Story 3.5: Market State Detection Agent

As a risk management system,
I want to understand current market conditions,
so that I can adjust trading behavior appropriately.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Market regime classification: trending, ranging, volatile, quiet
2: Session detection: Asian, London, New York with overlap periods
3: Economic event monitoring with 30-minute pre/post event windows
4: Correlation analysis between forex pairs and indices
5: Volatility measurement using ATR and historical volatility
6: Market state changes trigger strategy parameter adjustments
