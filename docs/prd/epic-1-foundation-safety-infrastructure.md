# Epic 1: Foundation & Safety Infrastructure

Establish the core project infrastructure with Git repository, CI/CD pipeline, and foundational safety systems including the Circuit Breaker Agent. This epic delivers a deployable system with emergency stop capabilities and basic health monitoring, ensuring we can safely build and test subsequent features.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Structure

As a developer,
I want a properly structured monorepo with all necessary configurations,
so that the team can begin development with consistent tooling and standards.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Monorepo created with folders: /agents, /execution-engine, /dashboard, /shared, /ml-models, /infrastructure
2: Git repository initialized with .gitignore, README, and protected main branch
3: Development environment setup documented with required tools and versions
4: Pre-commit hooks configured for linting and formatting (Python Black, ESLint, Prettier)
5: Docker Compose configuration for local development of all services
6: Basic health check endpoint responding at /health for each service

## Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline Foundation

As a DevOps engineer,
I want automated testing and deployment pipelines,
so that code quality is maintained and deployments are consistent.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: GitHub Actions workflow triggers on PR and merge to main
2: Automated running of unit tests with 80% coverage requirement
3: Build validation for all services (Python, TypeScript, Rust/Go)
4: Staging deployment triggered on main branch updates
5: Deployment rollback capability documented and tested
6: Build status badges displayed in repository README

## Story 1.3: Circuit Breaker Agent Core Implementation

As a system operator,
I want emergency stop capabilities at multiple levels,
so that I can immediately halt trading when risks are detected.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Circuit Breaker Agent responds to emergency stop commands within 100ms
2: Three-tier breaker system implemented: agent-level, account-level, system-level
3: Breakers trigger on: daily drawdown >5%, max drawdown >8%, unusual market conditions
4: All open positions closed when system-level breaker activates
5: Breaker status exposed via REST API and WebSocket for real-time monitoring
6: Manual override interface to activate breakers from dashboard

## Story 1.4: Inter-Agent Communication Infrastructure

As a system architect,
I want reliable message passing between agents,
so that the multi-agent system can coordinate effectively.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Kafka/NATS message broker deployed and configured
2: Event schema defined for all agent communication types
3: Message delivery guarantees implemented (at-least-once delivery)
4: Dead letter queue for failed messages
5: Message latency monitoring shows <10ms average between agents
6: Test harness created for simulating agent communication

## Story 1.5: Observability and Monitoring Foundation

As a system administrator,
I want comprehensive monitoring of system health,
so that I can detect and respond to issues before they impact trading.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: OpenTelemetry integrated for distributed tracing
2: Prometheus metrics exposed by all services
3: Grafana dashboards showing system health, latency, and resource usage
4: Alert rules configured for critical metrics (CPU >80%, Memory >70%, service down)
5: Centralized logging with structured JSON logs from all services
6: Log retention configured for 30 days with search capability
