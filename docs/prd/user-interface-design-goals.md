# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface prioritizes clarity and control, presenting complex multi-account trading data in a scannable, non-overwhelming format. The design philosophy emphasizes "glanceable compliance" where traders can instantly assess account health, risk status, and compliance state across all accounts without detailed inspection. Critical alerts and risk warnings take visual precedence, while routine profitable operations fade into the background.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Single-Screen Command Center:** All critical information visible without navigation, using progressive disclosure for details
- **Traffic Light System:** Green/Yellow/Red visual indicators for instant account status recognition
- **Drag-and-Drop Account Management:** Easily reorganize account priority and groupings
- **One-Click Emergency Controls:** Prominent emergency stop and pause buttons always accessible
- **Context-Sensitive Actions:** Right-click menus and hover states reveal account-specific actions

## Core Screens and Views

- Login/Authentication Screen with 2FA
- Main Dashboard - Multi-Account Command Center
- Individual Account Detail View
- Trade History & Performance Analytics
- Risk Configuration Panel
- Prop Firm Rules Management

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

## Branding

Professional financial interface aesthetic with dark mode default to reduce eye strain during extended monitoring. Clean, data-focused design inspired by institutional trading platforms like Bloomberg Terminal but with modern usability. Subtle use of brand colors only for critical alerts and CTAs.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on desktop (1920x1080 minimum) with responsive scaling for tablets. Mobile view provides read-only monitoring with emergency stop capabilities.
