# Epic 7: Adaptive Learning & Performance Optimization

Deploy learning systems with safeguards and performance tracking. This epic enables the system to improve over time while avoiding learning from corrupted data.

## Story 7.1: Performance Data Collection Pipeline

As a learning system,
I want comprehensive data about all trades and market conditions,
so that I can identify improvement opportunities.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Every trade logged with 50+ features including market conditions
2: Pattern success rates tracked by timeframe and market regime
3: Slippage and execution quality metrics collected
4: False signal analysis for rejected trades
5: Data validation ensuring no corrupted/manipulated data enters pipeline
6: Data retention for 1 year with efficient query capabilities

## Story 7.2: Learning Circuit Breaker Implementation

As a safety system,
I want to prevent learning during suspicious conditions,
so that the system doesn't learn from poisoned data.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Learning disabled during unusual market conditions (flash crashes, gaps)
2: Anomaly detection on win rates (sudden improvements = suspicious)
3: Data quarantine for suspicious periods pending manual review
4: Learning rollback capability to previous stable state
5: A/B testing framework for gradual change validation
6: Manual override to force or prevent learning periods

## Story 7.3: Adaptive Risk Parameter Tuning

As an optimization system,
I want to adjust risk parameters based on performance,
so that the system adapts to changing market conditions.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Position size adjustments based on 30-day rolling performance
2: Stop loss distance optimization using recent volatility data
3: Take profit levels adjusted based on achieved vs expected results
4: Signal confidence threshold tuning (75% might become 78%)
5: Maximum 10% parameter change per month to prevent instability
6: Parameter change logging with performance impact tracking

## Story 7.4: Strategy Performance Analysis

As an analyst system,
I want to evaluate strategy effectiveness,
so that I can disable underperforming approaches.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Individual strategy performance tracking with statistical significance
2: Market regime performance analysis (which strategies work when)
3: Correlation analysis between strategies for diversification
4: Underperformance detection with automatic strategy suspension
5: Strategy effectiveness reports generated weekly
6: Manual strategy enable/disable controls in dashboard

## Story 7.5: Continuous Improvement Pipeline

As an evolution system,
I want to systematically test and deploy improvements,
so that the system gets better over time.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Shadow mode testing for new strategies without real money
2: Gradual rollout process (10% → 25% → 50% → 100% of accounts)
3: Performance comparison between control and test groups
4: Automatic rollback if test group underperforms by >10%
5: Improvement suggestion log for human review
6: Monthly optimization report with implemented changes
