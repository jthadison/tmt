# Strategy Optimization Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Transform the current -0.60% trading performance into consistent positive returns through systematic strategy optimization and enhanced risk management.

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (2-week phases)
**Target Performance**: +3-5% monthly returns with <5% maximum drawdown

## Phase 1: Signal Generation Optimization (Weeks 1-2)

### Problem Analysis
- **Current State**: 172+ signals generated, only 5 executed (2.9% execution ratio)
- **Issue**: Over-conservative signal filtering or inadequate confidence scoring
- **Target**: Increase execution ratio to 15-20% while maintaining quality
