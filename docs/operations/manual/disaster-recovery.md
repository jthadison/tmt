## Recovery Procedures

### Procedure 1: Database Recovery

#### PostgreSQL Primary Failure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Database failover procedure

# Step 1: Verify primary database failure
if ! pg_isready -h primary-db -p 5432; then
    echo "Primary database failure confirmed"
    
    # Step 2: Promote standby to primary
    sudo -u postgres pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
    
    # Step 3: Update application connection strings
    sudo sed -i 's/primary-db/secondary-db/g' /etc/tmt/database.conf
    
    # Step 4: Restart applications to use new primary
    sudo systemctl restart tmt-agents
    
    # Step 5: Verify database connectivity
    psql -h secondary-db -U tmt_user -d tmt_production -c "SELECT version();"
    
    # Step 6: Update monitoring configuration
    /opt/tmt/scripts/update-monitoring-targets.sh
    
    echo "Database failover completed"
else
    echo "Primary database is accessible, failover not needed"
fi
```

#### Backup Restoration Process
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Database restoration from backup

# Step 1: Stop all applications
sudo systemctl stop tmt-agents
sudo systemctl stop tmt-execution-engine

# Step 2: Create restoration point
sudo -u postgres pg_dump tmt_production > /backup/pre-restore-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Step 3: Restore from backup
BACKUP_FILE="/backup/tmt_production_$(date +%Y%m%d)_000000.sql"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS tmt_production;"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE tmt_production;"
sudo -u postgres psql tmt_production < $BACKUP_FILE

# Step 4: Verify restoration
sudo -u postgres psql tmt_production -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trading_accounts;"

# Step 5: Start applications
sudo systemctl start tmt-execution-engine
sudo systemctl start tmt-agents

# Step 6: Verify system health
./scripts/system-health-check.sh
```

### Procedure 2: System Recovery

curl -f http://localhost:8004/health || exit 1

# Phase 3: Agent Recovery
echo "Phase 3: Agent recovery"

# Start agents in dependency order
agents=("circuit-breaker" "risk-management" "market-analysis" "anti-correlation" "personality-engine" "performance-tracker" "compliance" "learning-safety")

for agent in "${agents[@]}"; do
    echo "Starting $agent agent..."
    cd /opt/tmt/agents/$agent
    python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $((8000 + ${#agents[@]})) &
    sleep 30
    
    # Verify agent health
    port=$((8000 + ${#agents[@]}))
    curl -f http://localhost:$port/health || {
        echo "Failed to start $agent agent"
        exit 1
    }
done

# Phase 4: Dashboard Recovery
echo "Phase 4: Dashboard recovery"
cd /opt/tmt/dashboard
npm run start:production &
sleep 60

curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health || exit 1

# Phase 5: Verification
echo "Phase 5: System verification"
./scripts/post-recovery-validation.sh

echo "TMT system recovery completed successfully"
```

### Procedure 3: Failover to Secondary Site

#### Site Failover Process
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Failover to secondary data center

echo "Initiating failover to secondary site..."

# Step 1: Validate secondary site readiness
ssh disaster-recovery "cd /opt/tmt && ./scripts/site-readiness-check.sh"

# Step 2: Sync latest data
rsync -avz /var/lib/postgresql/data/ disaster-recovery:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
rsync -avz /etc/tmt/ disaster-recovery:/etc/tmt/

# Step 3: Update DNS records
./scripts/update-dns-to-secondary.sh

# Step 4: Start services on secondary site
ssh disaster-recovery "cd /opt/tmt && ./scripts/start-all-services.sh"

# Step 5: Verify secondary site operations
./scripts/verify-secondary-site.sh

# Step 6: Update monitoring
./scripts/update-monitoring-secondary.sh

echo "Failover to secondary site completed"
```

## Business Continuity Procedures

### Trading Continuity Plans

#### Reduced Operations Mode
When full system recovery isn't immediately possible:

1. **Manual Trading Oversight**
   - Risk Manager monitors positions manually
   - Manual position adjustments via broker platforms
   - Spreadsheet-based risk tracking

2. **Partial System Operations**
   - Core agents only (Circuit Breaker + Risk Management)
   - Reduced position sizes (50% of normal)
   - Increased monitoring frequency

3. **Communication Protocols**
   - Hourly stakeholder updates
   - Real-time risk manager notifications
   - Regulatory notification if required

#### Emergency Trading Halt
Complete trading cessation procedures:

```bash
# Emergency trading halt
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/emergency-stop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "disaster_recovery",
    "halt_all_trading": true,
    "close_positions": false
  }'

# Monitor existing positions
./scripts/monitor-positions-manual.sh

# Generate emergency reports
./scripts/generate-emergency-reports.sh
```
