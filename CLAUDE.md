This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Adaptive/Continuous Learning Autonomous Trading System - a sophisticated AI platform for prop firm traders. The system uses 8 specialized AI agents to manage multiple prop firm accounts simultaneously, employing Wyckoff methodology with Volume Price Analysis and Smart Money Concepts while maintaining compliance and avoiding detection.

## Project Status

## Architecture Implementation

**Production Architecture (Fully Deployed):**
- **Monorepo structure**: `/agents`, `/execution-engine`, `/dashboard`, `/orchestrator` - âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Event-driven microservices** with 8 specialized AI agents - âœ… **ALL AGENTS RUNNING**
- **Python 3.11+ with FastAPI** for all services - âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Next.js 14+ with TypeScript** for dashboard - âœ… **LIVE MONITORING**  
- **OANDA REST API integration** for trade execution - âœ… **CONNECTED & ACTIVE**
- **Real-time monitoring** and circuit breaker patterns - âœ… **100% OPERATIONAL**
- **Health monitoring system** for all 11 services - âœ… **ACTIVE MONITORING**

**Planned Extensions:**
- **CrewAI** for enhanced agent orchestration
- **Rust/Go execution engine** for <100ms critical path performance  
- **PostgreSQL 15+** for transactional data, **TimescaleDB** for market data
- **Kafka/NATS** for inter-agent communication
- **MetaTrader 4/5 integration** expansion

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: 8 AI agents must collaborate through event-driven messaging
2. **Sub-100ms Latency**: Signal-to-execution pipeline requires ultra-low latency
3. **Compliance Engine**: Real-time validation against varying prop firm rules
4. **Anti-Detection System**: Trading personalities and variance to avoid AI detection
5. **Learning Circuit Breakers**: Preventing adaptation during suspicious market conditions
6. **99.5% Uptime Requirement**: Mission-critical availability for live trading

## Security & Compliance Requirements

- End-to-end encryption for all data transmission
- API key encryption at rest using HashiCorp Vault
- 7-year audit trail retention
- SOC 2 Type II compliance roadmap
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Legal entity separation per trading account
