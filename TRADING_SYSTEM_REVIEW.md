# TMT Trading System - Comprehensive Technical Review (Updated)

## Executive Summary
After conducting an updated in-depth review of the TMT Trading System codebase, I've assessed its readiness for live market analysis and trading with OANDA. The system shows **significant development progress with major improvements** but remains **NOT READY** for production trading.

**Current Status: ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT/TESTING PHASE**
- ‚úÖ Core infrastructure deployed and running
- ‚úÖ OANDA connection established and validated
- ‚úÖ Enhanced safety mechanisms implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing production validation and testing
- ‚ùå Still not safe for live trading with real money

**Updated Readiness: 60% (increased from 35%)**

## Review Findings by Component

### 1. OANDA Integration ‚úÖ SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
